Reteach and Enrich: How to Make Time for Every Student (Transcript) Calvin Baker: Most of us grew up, classic American education, you know. You can go through a unit where these was math, social studies or English, and at the end of the unit, you had a test. Then you moved onto the next unit, because you had to get through all the chapters by the end of the school year. And some kids would do well, some wouldn’t. Some kids got good grades and some didn’t.

Katie Dabney: In the past, we would just move on to the next chapter in the book, and sorry if you didn’t get that. Maybe at the end of the year review, we’ll try and touch on that. We wanted to get away from that practice. We made sure that we had a time in the day where if students did not master the skill that was previously taught, we gave them time to master that.

Lindsey Flora: So these formatives are a way of assessing everything that you have learned about prime and composite numbers.

Crystal Deryke: So we’re gonna go ahead and get up our math offices. Put your first, last name on this test.

Nancy Varela: Is this a test that you have to take really fast?

Everybody: No.

Katie Dabney: What we do is we teach an objective, and that objective is calendared out for us. And at the end of teaching that objective, we would give a formative assessment, which is usually on Friday. Objectives usually last about a week. And based on the results of that formative assessment, we know if students have mastered that concept or if they have not mastered that. Then what teachers do is, they get together as a grade level and they look at their formatives, and they look at what students mastered that formative and which didn’t, and they divide students into the reteach group and into the enrich group.

Nancy Varela: And so how many reteaches are you looking at?

Lindsey Flora: I’m looking at five I reteach, yep.

Nancy Varela: Crystal, do you have your number yet?

Crystal Deryke: Yes, nine.

Nancy Varela: Matt, what were your numbers?

Matt Hough: Eight.

Katie Dabney: One of the things that we found through our experience with reteach and enrich is that the teacher who had a very good turnout on that formative assessment, they did something right in that classroom. They did something right with their instruction on that objective.

Lindsey Flora: Is it safe to say a composite number is a number that has more than two factors?

Everybody: Yes.

Lindsey Flora: Very good. All right, that’s what we’re gonna write down.

Katie Dabney: So we felt that that teacher would be the most appropriate person to teach the reteach group.

Nancy Varela: I think they just need a little more time on this is what it looks like.

Lindsey Flora: Exactly. Well, I’m open to doing reteach for prime and composite.

Nancy Varela: What about what you’ve got planned, Matt? You had some enrichments planned, didn’t you?

Matt Hough: Yeah, I did. I put three enrich programs together and three activities. I took what you had and I took what you had, and I took a sample on Marilyn Burns, and I just kinda read all three of them and I redid them on my board, on one of the poster boards. And I wrote it in like a child friendly version of it.

Cheryl Deryke: Of the divisibility rules?

Matt Hough: Yeah. And I gave an example underneath each one.

Nancy Varela: All right. So are we all set? Everybody feel comfy?

Lindsey Flora: Sounds good to me.

Cheryl Deryke: Yeah, I think so.

Katie Dabney: That following week, every day, Monday through Friday, from twelve thirty to one o’clock, we have reteach and enrich going on school wide. So the teachers that are teaching reteach, they have that reteach group and they stay with that group of students for that entire week. The enrichment students, they’re split up and they would rotate between all of the other teachers in that grade level.

Lindsey Flora: Today in reteach, we’re going to be going over prime and composite numbers.

Erica: I think reteach is kind of nice because if you don’t understand something, you won’t go on until you understand it, so you won’t be confused with anything else, and the teachers do help you. I realize that it’s not really bad. It’s just that you just need a little bit more help with it.

Matt Hough: You guys did really well on your formative last week and so today’s your chance to do an enrichment portion. I really wanna challenge you. I’m giving you that option. Do you wanna do prime and composite, zero to a hundred, or do you wanna try prime and composite, zero to two hundred, using those digits? With a thumbs up, how many of you guys wanna do a hundred to two hundred? All right. I’m gonna go for the two hundred too and I’ll help you out and I’ll help you out as well.

Katie Dabney: We knew that it worked because the very year that we took our AIMs or our standardized test, our school became an excelling school. Our achievement is the highest in the state of Arizona, so that’s something that we’re very proud of.

Calvin Baker: When we hold students accountable for very specific standards, and we expect all of them to know that standard, then we hold ourselves accountable for getting that job done. And that is a very significant shift from simply saying, ‘You know what, I made it all the way through the textbook.’

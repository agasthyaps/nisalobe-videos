## Transcript

Narrator: Historically, students with physical and learning disabilities were often placed in special education classrooms, ostensibly to provide them with tailored instruction. But, in more recent years, advocates backed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act have pushed to open the doors of general education classrooms to all students. Research about the effectiveness of this approach has been sparse. Now, a 2022 study strikes a clear confirmatory note. After analyzing the academic records of nearly 24,000 adolescents who qualified for special education, researchers concluded that spending 80 percent or more time in general education classes improved reading scores by a whopping 24 points and math scores by 18 points, compared to students who spent more time in special education classrooms. The benefits of inclusion extended well into the future, too, by preparing students with disabilities for successful educational and employment opportunities. With our best instincts now backed by evidence, we should continue to treat the general education classroom as the default classroom and seek alternatives only when it’s clearly in a child’s best interest.

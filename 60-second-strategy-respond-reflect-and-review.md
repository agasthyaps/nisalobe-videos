## Transcript

Teacher: Using your desk as a whiteboard, answer questions and then we’ll start the rotations.

Teacher: The Respond, Reflect, Review Protocol is an active-engagement activity where students evaluate each other’s work. The first part of it, students respond to a given question or prompt.

Teacher: When the timer dings, be ready to rotate. <ding> Teacher: They rotate in order to reflect on what was written and leave a piece of feedback.

Teacher: How can your partner strengthen their response? <ding> Rotation 2.

Teacher: And then they rotate to a different desk, and leave a positive affirmation or a praise. <ding> Once they return to their desk, they’re able to review and share.

Girl: Marvin said, “I like your evidence. It really supports your answer.” Teacher: Okay.

Teacher: It really helps students understand what makes a good response and ways to improve their own learning.

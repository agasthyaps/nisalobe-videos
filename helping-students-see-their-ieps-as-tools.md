## Article

Millions of students across the U.S. have individualized education programs (familiarly known as IEPs) designed to support their learning needs, but few truly understand the details within the legally binding document—or how they can actually benefit from them. Transition coordinator Christen Brabenec is looking to change that. In her position at Olmsted Falls City Schools in Ohio, Brabenec works with middle and high school students to help them understand their IEPs more deeply and begin to use them to advocate for themselves.

At Olmsted Middle School, Brabenec hosts a small group of students monthly for sessions pertaining to special education topics—everything from career exploration and independent living skills to college readiness. On this particular day, she’s using the time to introduce them to an IEP—what’s in it, why they matter, and how they can serve as powerful tools from middle school through graduation. As Brabenec explains, “A lot of students know they have one, but they don’t understand what the document is.” She leads the small group of students through the document, examining key sections, making sense of resources and accommodations, and discussing how they can take an active role in their IEP meetings.

And, as students get older, she sees a big difference in how they engage in their annual IEP meetings. “We start with basic knowledge, but moving forward, they know about it, they know when their meetings are, and they say, ‘I want to be there,’” she says. For students, understanding their IEP is like having a road map—a clear guide toward their goals.

It also begins the eye-opening process of students having a say in what they want to do with their lives. They begin to see how each step builds toward the future they want to achieve. And by changing their perception of their IEPs from a dull paperwork requirement to a valuable tool for self-advocacy, Brabenec helps students connect what and how they’re learning today to where they want to go tomorrow.

## Transcript

Christen Brabenec: The whole point of this document is to encompass all your strengths and all your needs.

Christen Brabenec: Because we teach students about their IEPs, they feel empowered to use them as a tool that will support them from middle school to graduation, and it’s something that they can be in control of.

Christen Brabenec: Today we are going to be talking about the IEP document in general. Once a month I visit our middle school and we focus on career exploration, independent living skills, and then college.

Christen Brabenec: Today I did a lesson specifically about the IEP, because a lot of students know they have one, but they don’t understand what the document is.

Christen Brabenec: Why do you think we start the IEP with what you want to do for your future?

Student: So that they can just like teach you and like help you get to that goal?

Christen Brabenec: Absolutely. It’s like a road map, right?

Christen Brabenec: The IEP is a living, breathing document, and it’s like a tool for them to take charge of to help them to get where they want to be.

Christen Brabenec: Everybody’s input goes into your profile, so why don’t you take a look at your profile. We went through four or five major sections of the IEP, and then how they can be a contributing member of the IEP team.

Christen Brabenec: Let’s look at what are some things that it said you needed to work on?

Student: Study skills.

Christen Brabenec: Study skills.

Christen Brabenec: The progression is we start with basic knowledge, but moving forward, they know about it. They know when their meetings are, and they are actively seeking that out and they say, “I want to be there.” Student: Respectful, polite, follows teacher’s directions.

Christen Brabenec: Students who are engaged in their IEP have learned to use their resources through their IEP meetings so they see the importance of that. And with each time we meet, their voice becomes stronger and students feel empowered by that. Does anybody know any accommodations?

Student: Extended time on assessments.

Christen Brabenec: Yeah. Extended time on assessments.

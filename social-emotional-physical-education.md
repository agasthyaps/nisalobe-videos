## Article

PE classes have come a long way, points out New Jersey wellness teacher Suzanne Horsley, whose job title reflects her district’s dedication to making the class about more than just physical exercise. When she was in school, “we tended to the movement side of things, but we didn’t necessarily attend to the emotional or the social.” Today, in Horsley’s class, kids still get exposed to the standard fare of physical skills, but they also have ample opportunity to practice things like cooperation, team-building, perseverance, and kindness. All of her classes incorporate personal goal-setting, Socratic seminars, and time for personal and whole group reflection.

One special feature is daily journal time, which supports goal-setting and self-awareness (not to mention writing practice). Even the youngest of students keep a journal—Horsley encourages her kindergarten students to draw their goals and accomplishments. Horsley goes out of her way to create a space where all students feel comfortable trying out new physical skills.

“Wellness is a class that we learn in front of each other,” she says. “It’s not like any other subject area. So if we don’t set up a safe space for learning, we’re not going to have everybody involved in the learning process.” To learn more about integrating SEL skill building in gym class, see Alli McKain’s article for Edutopia titled “ Setting Up an SEL Program in Physical Education Classes ” or Doug Curtin’s article “ SEL Possibilities in Physical Education .”

## Transcript

Suzanne Horsley: On your mark, get set, go!

Horsley: So in addition to physical skills students would learn in a wellness class, there are these emotional and social pieces like persevering, empathy, kindness, respect.

Horsley: You can tell me one thing that went really well today.

Student: We worked as a team.

Horsley: We point out ways that we can encourage each other. So when a student leaves a wellness class, they feel prepared to handle anything that comes their way throughout the day.

Horsley: So the school mission at Tollgate is to develop curiosity to be lifelong learners through play, through experiential education. All of the things that we do in the wellness class or gym support that mission. The end result for a wellness class is for students to feel comfortable moving, to feel comfortable in their skin.

Michael: Gym isn’t just sports and techniques. You learn about little strategies in life, like a lot about cooperating. I like the personal goals a lot because we keep persevering and feel accomplished.

Horsley: We start all of my classes doing personal goals. It’s a great way for the students to have some choice. It could be practicing their dribbling skills in basketball, juggling, trying to run faster, jump farther.

Student: I did throwing for long distance. So I threw the ball, and then I walked back, and I see how many paces I had.

Horsley: Today they did their personal goals for 10 minutes, and then they have that time for reflection.

Braelyn: Our journals, we write in like what we’ve done that day and what we’ve accomplished.

Michael: Today I wrote about how I felt with the amount of paces that I got. I can push myself and work towards whatever I want to work towards.

Horsley: As they get older, these are things that they’re going to be doing for their entire life, setting goals in all kinds of ways. Put your notebooks away, and then let’s circle up under… We then gathered for a Socratic seminar where we kind of hone in on the skills that we’re going to work on, but sometimes the emotional components. Today’s lesson was to create their own tag game, but I wanted them to first get anchored in on some of the key things that they needed to do as a group.

Braelyn: You have to make sure that everyone feels included.

Student: You have to be able to make a compromise. During the Socratic seminar, we don’t just all speak at once, like we give the other person a turn and then you can go.

Braelyn: And then we got into different groups, and we got to pick a story starter and we made a game out of it. My story starter was a train went into a dark mountain tunnel.

Student: Let’s just say the passengers are trying to get to it, but robbers come in and try to tag them.

Braelyn: We like to mix ideas together so everyone has a part in it.

Student: Yeah, that’s a good idea.

Michael: We had a few arguments.

Student: No, the archaeologist opens the box and then they turn into a zombie or something.

Michael: But we were eventually able to agree on one idea.

Horsley: It’s a really important part of wellness, giving them that agency and for me to stay out of it so that they can experience the learning, because that’s where it’s going to happen. All right, everybody, come on over here.

Student: Then we presented it to everyone, and we got to have everyone play the games.

Horsley: Tell us your game. Go over all the rules.

Student: Our setting was a dragon castle, and the dragons have the pennies and the pool noodles, and if you pull out the dragon’s tail, the dragon becomes a human.

Horsley: Here we go. On your mark, get set, go.

Horsley: Sometimes the students in my space will be very different than they are in a classroom setting where they aren’t comfortable or sure about how to express some of the feelings that they have or manage stress that they are experiencing. I lay as much of the foundation as I can to relieve some of those anxieties. So when they’ve left me, they’re more calm emotionally and they are definitely more ready to learn.

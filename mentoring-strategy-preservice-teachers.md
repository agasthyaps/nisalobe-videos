## Transcript

Abby Markley: So we’re going to have three stations today you guys. Okay, Mr. Kiefer.

Isaac Kiefer: Alright, station one with myself, Yousef, Abbie, Hayley … Margaret Hudson: With co-teaching, since we started it’s implementation, it’s really strengthened the learning process for our student teachers, and made a positive impact on the students’ learning. It decreases the group size and allows more interaction between both the teacher and the students, as well as the students and their peers.

Margaret Hudson: The Lab school partners with the College of Ed as part of a teacher education institute to help prepare teachers.

Isaac Kiefer: Are humans bound to destroy themselves, that’s a question, right?

Margaret Hudson: So, we get utilized heavily for a lot of the pre-service teachers’ practicum experiences.

Julie Kortum: We’re gonna be on an adventure.

Margaret Hudson: Because of that, the teachers here have become masterful at really utilizing all the adults to make a positive difference for the students that they serve.

Jayne Hellenberg: Co-teaching is when two or more teachers work together in all aspects of instruction. So from planning, to instruction, to assessment.

Abby Markley: We’re just gonna take a look at your writing, here, I guess take it from yesterday.

Jayne Hellenberg: There are always two teachers in the room working with students.

Isaac Kiefer: Helisa.

Helisa: Is what elements of modern warfare do you see in Wayne’s letter?

Isaac Kiefer: Okay, good.

Abby Markley: We were given this list of strategies in our training, and we were just asked to think about any way that we could try to draw on those as much as possible. So a lot of it is looking at those strategies and trying to match it with what the kids need.

Abby Markley: We’re gonna be in about groups of four, okay? Everybody is going to go to all three rotations. Alright, let’s do it!

Isaac Kiefer: There’s one that’s discussed in all four of these pictures, and what you guys came up with.

Jayne Hellenberg: During station teaching, each of the teachers has an individual station with a different lesson plan, and students are working independently at a station.

Abby Markley: Alright, we are going to rotate now folks.

Jayne Hellenberg: And it is very valuable for our student teachers to teach the same lesson, numerous times. They make little small tweaks with every lesson.

Isaac Kiefer: What sticks out to you when you’re looking at this?

Student: Blown up trees, injured people.

Isaac Kiefer: Can you tell me more?

Isaac Kiefer: I think the great thing about co-teaching is that having the burden not necessarily 100% put on you right from the start. It’s almost a great way to have training wheels if you’re coming in and don’t have a lot of teaching experience. Good teaching can be good teaching whether it’s two kids or forty, but it’s easier definitely to manager fewer bodies.

Isaac Kiefer: So that’s kind of one of the things that Sarah Teasdale’s seeing.

Abby Markley: Bradbury’s writing about 20 years after Teasdale.

Abby Markley: I mean it’s what’s best for kids, right? They can work with me and Isaac all in the same hour. Kids aren’t gonna fall through the cracks, we’re going to have lots of ways for us to reach our kids.

Helisa: They both have different teaching styles, but they work well together so if you don’t understand one thing Ms. Markley said you could ask Mr. Kiefer, and he’ll tell you in a different way.

Teacher: To be effective at co-teaching, there has to be co-planning.

Julie Kortum: So today, we’re going to do our role playing, so we’re going to be co-teaching that.

Brittany Montez: And we’re gonna assist them with filling out their pros and cons sheet.

Julie Kortum: Yeah.

Brittany Montez: We plan everything together, which helps me, because through the planning process I can ask her questions, so that when I’m on my own I know what to expect.

Julie Kortum: Good morning, good morning. This morning, Mrs. Montez and I, we are going to act out a scene, that might have happened in 1849.

Jayne Hellenberg: The purpose of team teaching is to seamlessly teach together. Teachers plan the lesson and say, I’ll take this part, you take this part, but both of them are actively engaged from the planning to the instruction.

Julie Kortum: You have to decide, yes, I would move west during the Gold Rush, or no, I would not move west … Julie Kortum: It makes me a better teacher because I want to model for them, what a good teacher looks like, so I am more careful about what I plan and how I plan it.

Margaret Hudson: It changes the role from master teacher and student teacher, and creates this sense of, we’re in this together, and we both have important roles.

Julie Kortum: When I’m watching her teach, when she’s watching me teach, we learn from each other.

Brittany Montez: If you are gonna be a homesteader, join me over here.

Julie Kortum: And anyone who wants to strike it rich, come with me!

Margaret Hudson: I think alot of the teacher candidates come in a little bit nervous about implementing co-teaching strategies, but they leave saying that it has been a great experience and that they feel very prepared to go out and begin their profession.

Julie Kortum: They do come out as better teachers. They’re not sitting and watching, they’re up on their feet, they’re involved in the planning, and the instruction, and the classroom management. It’s good for them, it’s good for me, it’s good for the students, it’s great for the school, so there’s tons of benefits.

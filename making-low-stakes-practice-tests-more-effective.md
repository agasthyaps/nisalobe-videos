# Making (Low-Stakes) Practice Tests More Effective

> Practice tests not only help surface gaps in knowledge—they also strengthen memory.

## Article

Frequent, low-stakes quizzes help boost memory. In a 2014 study , students who simply reread material for an upcoming exam scored 50 percent, on average. But students who took practice tests did much better—scoring 66 percent on the exam.

Research shows that when students rely exclusively on reviewing or rereading the material, they can develop a false impression that they understand the topic. Practice tests help close the gap between what students know and what they think they know. To get the most out of practice tests, make them low-stakes, which can help decrease test anxiety .

Timing also matters: It’s helpful to give a practice test right after a lesson and continue to give them throughout the school year . Since students may not realize what questions they got wrong—or why—be sure to give feedback . Finally, simple prep strategies (such as flash cards ) can dramatically improve a student’s performance.

Narrator: Research shows that frequent, low-stakes quizzes help students remember more of what they’re learning. In a 2014 study, for example, students who simply reread material for an upcoming exam scored 50 percent on average. But students who took practice tests did much better, scoring 66 percent on the exam. So, why are practice tests so effective? It’s not just that they reveal gaps in knowledge, research also shows that memories are strengthened when information is frequently retrieved. So, practice tests not only assess what students know, but also increase their ability to recall information. All too often, though, students rely exclusively on simply rereading the material. And without quizzes to identify areas of weakness, they can develop a false impression that they understand the topic. So, here are five tips for effective practice tests. Make it low-stakes, or no-stakes. High-stakes tests can increase student anxiety and impair performance. So, ditch the grades and encourage students to focus on learning. Don’t delay. Research suggests that a short quiz right after a lesson will help reinforce the material. Practice regularly. Don’t stop at just one practice quiz. Instead, space them throughout the school year. Provide feedback. Students may not realize what questions they got wrong, or why. So, allow time for feedback and give students space to reflect on their own learning. Give students simple prep strategies. Encourage students to use flashcards, which can dramatically improve knowledge retention, for example.

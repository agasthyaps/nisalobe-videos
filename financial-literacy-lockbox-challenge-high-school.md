## Article

“With the pandemic, kids have been staring at screens for a couple of years now,” says Susan Bistransin, of Prince George’s County Public Schools. “And they relish being able to get away from that. I think part of what they lost—not just learning loss during the pandemic—was socialization.

Working in teams is something that doesn’t come naturally to most kids anymore.” Bistransin and other teachers at Parkdale High School in Riverdale, Maryland, have found that high school students are more engaged in off-screen activities, particularly ones where kids get to work together. In Oscar Peña’s financial literacy class, kids collaborate on a regular basis. Eleventh grader Iraima enjoys the fact that she gets to talk with other classmates and share opinions.

“I’ve definitely built a lot of friendships throughout the class.” In this fun lesson, kids race against the clock to test their knowledge of what they’ve learned about online banking. Like escape rooms, this kind of activity is built around a story or scenario, and it works well for reviewing information at the end of a unit or before an assessment.

## Transcript

Oscar Peña: Check the answers.

Student: It’s wrong.

Student: It’s wrong? Oscar Peña: Maybe it’s one that you need to check.

Susan Bistransin: The engagement with this activity is really because it’s so hands-on. With the pandemic, kids have been staring at screens for a couple of years now, and they relish being able to get away from that.

Student: How can we explain the strong password?

Susan Bistransin: Part of what they lost was socialization. Working in groups doesn’t come naturally to most kids anymore. It’s a wonderful way to build those soft skills. Oscar Peña: You got it. Yes.

Susan Bistransin: Parkdale High School has a rich diverse population. We have over 100 countries represented here. The teachers are doing a great job helping these students get ready for the future.

Iraima: Financial literacy is a very interactive class. We usually have discussions. Everybody has different opinions on things.

Raphael: I like how for each lesson there’s a real-life example that we have to connect from, like, our real lives to what we’re learning.

Susan Bistransin: So in Mr. Peña’s class we did a lockout challenge, and it’s similar to an escape room. Through the challenges they acquired the key to unlock the next one. So their scenario was they had a fellow classmate who just got a job and wants to do online banking. But his auntie is very old-fashioned and says no.

Student: She does not trust online banking. You have a series of four tasks to convince Auntie that online banking is what Daniel needs. Oscar Peña: Let’s open the envelopes. Work together to find the answers.

Raphael: First, we had to match the words with the definition.

Iraima: A fee that is charged if you withdraw more money from your account is? Overdraft. Overdraft fees.

Student: So that’s contact with, huh?

Student: That one is this one.

Student: Person to person?

Student: Yeah. Put that one. Oscar Peña: One group already found all the answers.

Raphael: They had a key. We have to add all the numbers up. That was the code for challenge one. That would unlock the next challenge that we had to do. Challenge two, Daniel’s auntie had some examples of why online bank was bad, and there was an article. We tried to find stuff in the article that would counterpoint her argument.

Student: The fourth bullet says you can download statements to print them at home. Yes.

Raphael: Challenge three was learning about specific banking apps like Google Pay, Venmo, Zelle. Oscar Peña: So tell me which one is the one that charges more fees?

Raphael: It’s a tie between Cash App and Venmo. Oscar Peña: Which one would you use?

Raphael: Cash App. Oscar Peña: Cash App. Oscar Peña: There is a group that’s going for the fourth and last challenge.

Raphael: Challenge four was about security.

Iraima: OK. That one should be “Don’t click on email attachments from unknown sources.” Student: Security enabled website addresses start with HTTPS.

Raphael: Yeah. Yeah.

Student: That’s right for the last piece.

Student: It’s wrong. No.

Iraima: Oh, shoot.

Student: This is for the red one. Oscar Peña: Yes.

Student: We won. Oscar Peña: Excellent job. We are so proud of what you guys did, the interaction, the activity, the knowledge.

Susan Bistransin: The last thing they were asked to do was to write a note to Daniel’s auntie explaining why she should let him use online banking.

Iraima: I thought it was really fun. I liked working with teams and talking to my classmates. And I’ve definitely built a lot of friendships throughout the class. Oscar Peña: Having the chance to work together, they were able to engage more with the topic, and they’re excited about that.

Susan Bistransin: It’s not just taking notes. It’s not just watching a PowerPoint. They’re interacting with each other, with the teacher, and it just makes learning fun. Oscar Peña: Thank you guys for a great evening. See you again on Friday. Oscar Peña

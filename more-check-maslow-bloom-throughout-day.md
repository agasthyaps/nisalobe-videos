## Article

The phrase “Maslow before Bloom” is a cliché in education for good reason: Paying attention to students’ social and emotional needs primes their developing brains for learning, so that they are better able to take in and process lessons. Different teachers will prefer different tools, and the point here is not to try all of the strategies you’ll find in the article below. Instead, pick a few: some movement breaks to use up some energy, calming routines like mindfulness activities when students seem to need to recenter themselves, and so on.

Greeting students at the door is a good idea for everyday use, but after that, each teacher will put Maslow before Bloom in their own way, throughout the day. To learn more about these strategies, including the research behind them, please see “ How to Maslow Before Bloom, All Day Long. ”

Narrator: Focusing on a student’s basic need for safety and belonging before turning to academics is a common idea in education. So common, it can be summed up in three words: Maslow before Bloom. But it’s not simple. It takes work and intention to integrate Maslow into your classroom. Get started by greeting every student by name at the door in the morning. A simple practice that activates feelings of connectedness and belonging, while improving student engagement and behavior. Once students are settled in the room, spend a few minutes on nonacademic conversation involving all students to foster a strong sense of community. And do a quick temperature check to identify students who are not emotionally prepared to learn. Those started practices prime students for learning but incorporating Maslow shouldn’t end there. The need to regulate emotions, recharge batteries, and connect socially will crop up throughout the day, just as it does for adults. So, here are five teacher-tested ways to integrate social-emotional and refocusing strategies throughout your school day. Students will lose focus periodically, for elementary students after about ten minutes of direct instruction. Use short brain breaks, like playing a game or singing a song to help them refocus. When students can’t seem to hold still, a movement break can help. Consider GoNoodle or Hype The Breaks. Dance and movement videos for elementary and middle school, or just try some jumping jacks! Sometimes a student is too worked up. And a movement break simply won’t do the trick. Create a Peace Corner. A spot in the room with stuffed animals, books, and a form where students can describe or draw out their feelings to bring them back to calmness and teach emotional self-regulation. More and more, the research says that mindfulness works. Simple activities like focusing on breathing for 40 seconds helps students release stress and boosts their focus and working memory. Unstructured play gives students room to consolidate what they’re learning, get exercise, and build strong social connections. Teachers face relentless pressure to push through lessons and get students ready for tests. But the science and the research are clear, students do better academically within systems that regularly meet their social and emotional needs.

Consistent hands-on interactions with nature have proven benefits for both learning outcomes and emotional well-being. By creating regular opportunities for students to access and immerse themselves in the natural world—both inside and outside of the classroom—teachers encourage them to start connecting elementary classroom content to nature in tangible and relevant ways. In science, many lessons already align organically, since they provide students with opportunities to observe natural phenomena in the world around them.

One great place to start is with a classic activity like growing, documenting, and measuring plants from seeds or, similarly, observing the life cycles of fish in a classroom. In art, natural materials can spark creativity and imagination. Students can use foraged items like leaves, sticks, flowers, and stones to create prints, build structures, or explore open-ended projects.

This approach allows students to explore textures, patterns, and colors, fostering an appreciation for the shapes and diversity found in nature. Taking learning outdoors can bring fresh energy into language arts lessons. Students can take walks to observe and document their surroundings in a nature journal .

Once back in the classroom, any notes, pictures, or drawings that students made while on their walk can be used to inspire creative writing projects like essays, poems, or short stories. In math lessons , using natural objects like pine cones, flowers, rocks, and leaves for counting, identifying patterns, measuring, and exploring symmetry lines can help students see all the ways math is found in the great outdoors. When young students have frequent opportunities to investigate the natural world around them, it creates a deeper way of connecting to nature—and a sense of stewardship that will last well beyond their time in the elementary classroom.

Narrator: Bringing the natural world into daily activities and lessons not only has proven benefits for learning and emotional well-being, it can also be simple and easy to do. Here are some ways you can start including the magic of nature in your elementary curriculum in any subject area. Science lessons have some of the most obvious connections to nature, since they offer organic opportunities for students to observe natural phenomena. You can start with a long, beloved activity like growing plants from seeds. Let each child plant a seed in a cup. Beans, snap peas, and herbs are tried and true, and document each stage of the plant’s life cycle while measuring its growth and noting when it flowers and produces seeds. You could take this concept a step further by tracking and studying the growth, diet, water composition, and habitats of fish in a classroom aquarium. Giving students a front row seat to the ever-changing cycles and stages of plants and animals can keep them engaged with science lessons and activities. Getting creative with natural materials in art lessons can inspire a new level of imagination. Use easily foraged supplies like leaves, sticks, flowers, and stones in art projects. You can experiment with creating prints, building structures, or leaving the project open-ended to see where their curiosity takes them. This is a wonderful way for students to explore textures, patterns, and color, while learning to appreciate shapes found in their natural environment. Taking learning outdoors can bring a whole new element of refreshed creativity to language arts lessons. Take your students on walks where they can observe and take notes in a nature journal on their surroundings. Even if you teach in a dense urban area, there are usually trees and insects to be found in the schoolyard, or maybe you can access a nearby park. Back in the classroom, they can use any notes, pictures, or drawings they created as inspiration for creative writing projects, whether a poem, story, or essay. There is so much math to be found in nature. Introducing mathematical concepts through naturally occurring processes and materials can spark a light bulb moment for students about how math connects to their world. Use objects like pine cones, flowers, rocks, and leaves for counting, identifying patterns, measuring, and exploring symmetry lines. These activities help students improve their math skills while also gaining a tangible understanding of how math exists in their everyday lives. When elements from the great outdoors are woven into curriculum, learning becomes more relatable and relevant, helping students see the connections between their classroom environment and the natural world around them.

Why do kids often draw self-portraits that don’t look like them? Says art teacher Libya Doman, kids internalize messages early on “that thin bodies are to be celebrated… that straight hair is the norm” and that “white is right.” What can teachers do to help their students, especially BIPOC kids, draw themselves, and others, more authentically? Doman offers several practical strategies for helping kids “slow down the looking,” so they can see and draw differences.

She also stresses the importance of stocking inclusive art supplies. For additional tips on supporting kids to see in “more color-expansive ways,” download this comprehensive action guide from EmbraceRace , a nonprofit that provides resources for parents who want to raise their children to be more thoughtful and informed about race.

Teacher: As an art educator, I can be working with a lovely chocolate-brown child and it wouldn’t be surprising for them to draw a self-portrait where the person has very light skin and straight yellow hair. You know, it really saddens me when I see children who are really truly beautiful just as they are, but they’re not as aware of their beauty, because they see all of these images that celebrate people that don’t exactly look like them. So, as I ask kids to make self-portraits or portraits, one of the things that I really want them to do is to slow down. As we think about the diversity of people that we can draw, we’re going to have conversations about what different bodies look like, what different hair looks like. We’re going to spend a little time looking at photographs and differentiating how one person’s eyebrows are fuller and others are quite thin. And lastly, we spend quite a bit of time looking in mirrors, seeing what our faces do when we make different expressions like when we’re happy or we’re sad. One of the things that you can use to help kids notice differences between people is a sheet of paper that has different ways eyes are, different types of nose [sic], and different types of hair. And what you want them to do is to try to draw as many different kinds of people all on the same page, because in that they’re really kind of tuning in to the small differences or even the major differences we all have. Another way is to ask them to draw a self-portrait with a friend. When they start drawing, they notice like, “Hm! Who’s taller? Who’s shorter? Who’s wider? Whose hair goes straight up? Whose hair is down below their shoulders?” We really have to be conscious of the materials that we introduce to the kids, being intentional in purchasing crayon colors, making sure that you have paper that’s not just white, right? My school system, we use paint stations. I needed to have more variations of tan and brown so that the kids could look in those paint stations and say, “Hey, I’m represented here,” or “My mom is represented here,” or “My dad is represented here.” So over the years when I’ve used these strategies, I have noticed quite a few wins. There are some kids that will stick with the Disney princess, because, you know, those images are pervasive. I say to kids, “We’re going to keep looking and we’re going to keep drawing so that we can draw people authentically as they are. And what is better than actually being seen for who you are?”

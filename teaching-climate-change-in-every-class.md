# Making Climate Change Connections in Every Class

> When students learn about climate change across the curriculum, they see different parts of the problem—and different ways to be part of the solution.

## Article

Climate change is a multifaceted problem that requires interdisciplinary solutions, points out Margaret Wang, cofounder of Subject to Climate , a national nonprofit that supports teachers across all content areas and grade levels with credible and engaging resources (including full lesson plans) about climate change. What sparks the interest of one student (say, math) may be totally different from another (say, art). And we need everyone, across all disciplines, to be involved in finding solutions.

In keeping with this approach, New Jersey recently became the first state to start integrating climate education across all content areas, K–12. It makes sense, says wellness teacher Suzanne Horsley. “We are a state with a huge shoreline—and are impacted by climate change in a lot of ways.” Kids are hearing about climate-related natural disasters on a regular basis, and they’re passionate about the topic.

“So the ways in which we can provide a foundation, as teachers, are really important.” While many teachers may feel daunted by the idea of incorporating climate education into their classes, Wang offers assurances. “Schools in other states can learn from New Jersey by seeing how climate change can seamlessly integrate into what teachers are already teaching,” she says. What’s really important is that teachers have the support and resources to do so.

And while New Jersey may be the first place to teach climate change across the curriculum, it won’t be unique for long. The Los Angeles Unified School District has passed a resolution for climate change to be taught in all grade levels and subjects. In Oregon, legislation is pending to follow suit.

In Maine, the government has allocated $2 million for professional development in climate change. And in Wisconsin, there are new environmental literacy standards. Horsley and Wang agree that the way teachers approach the subject is important— playing games and doing design challenges are just two great ways to get kids out of their seats and moving while they’re learning about climate change, which has the potential to be anxiety provoking.

It’s important that kids be reminded of solutions and their own agency in helping with these solutions. After doing a recent climate change activity with her third-grade students, teacher Cari Gallagher noted, “When I see the positivity in the responses, I feel just great inside. Their takeaway is, ‘OK, this is how it is, but this is how we’re going to fix it.’” Her student Max agrees: “Climate change is dangerous, but we shouldn’t panic, because we can help stopping it.

We could help stop it every day by doing little things that add up to big things.” To learn more about the efforts in New Jersey, read Daniel Leonard’s article for Edutopia, “ Teaching Climate Change in Every Subject .”

## Transcript

Girl: Climate change can bully our earth. The carbon dioxide makes the earth heat up so much.

Cari Gallagher: Because my students learn about climate change in every subject area, they’re going to move forward knowing how to solve problems, how to use critical thinking, and really think about their choices when it comes to environmental awareness. Because I want them to step up.

Girl: If we help climate change, then we can help the land last forever.

Margaret Wang: Recently, New Jersey became the first state to integrate climate change education across all grade levels and subjects. Kids are learning about climate change not just in their science classes; they’re learning about it in art, in math, in English.

Aditi: It’s the interesting topic for most kids because it’s going on around us.

Cari Gallagher: They have seen firsthand how New Jersey has been hit pretty hard by climate change in the destructions of houses and homes. This is our environment. This is the place we love.

David: I like learning about climate change so that you could help protect the earth. And I also feel maybe a teensy bit sad, but I don’t really think about that a lot, since I’m having so much fun in gym class.

Suzanne Horsley: We’re going to head outside.

Suzanne Horsley: Sometimes for students, sitting still it’s really hard to hear the information about climate change or about an endangered species. And so, when we can do it, and well as they can move and express some of the things that they’re feeling.

Suzanne Horsley: All right, just come have a seat right here. Here’s what I want you to do first. Just see if you can find your pulse right here.

Suzanne Horsley: It’s impossible to talk about the health of the planet but not talk about the health of us as humans.

Sloane: So, at first we felt right here, how it’s bumping, like beating. Then we ran to the soccer goal.

Suzanne Horsley: Once they ran their warm-up run, they took their pulse again. So, they know something has changed.

Boy: Well, I noticed when you exercise— Suzanne Horsley: Yeah.

Boy: —you breathe faster. Your heart has to work faster to get oxygen to all parts of the body.

Suzanne Horsley: I love it. So, let’s—we’re going to do a little activity. And what I want— Suzanne Horsley: We played a game, it’s called Catch Your Breath. It was sort of an introduction to the carbon cycle. We inhale oxygen and then, of course, exhale carbon dioxide. And trees in the biome, they do the opposite. So, the goal of the game was to clear the carbon dioxide and get it to the trees.

Suzanne Horsley: This, my friends, is the carbon dioxide. If the tree catches it, then the tree is absorbing that carbon dioxide. And I’m going to time us to see how quickly we can get all of that carbon dioxide out. So, we’re a class working together.

Suzanne Horsley: At the beginning, we played the game set in the 1500s. There was a limited amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Suzanne Horsley: All right, go.

Suzanne Horsley: So, it was a real visual way for them to understand that carbon cycle, this abstract concept.

Suzanne Horsley: We’re almost done. We got a few left. All right, that took us one minute and 31 seconds.

Suzanne Horsley: Then we moved into the same exact game but in the current day of 2023. So, as we know, deforestation has occurred.

Suzanne Horsley: But guess what else? We’ve got a lot more carbon dioxide. So, I gave them the minute and 30 seconds to see how much they could clear.

Suzanne Horsley: Go!

Students: Go, go, go.

Suzanne Horsley: Keep working, concentrate on your catching skills.

Boy: Yes, I got another one.

Suzanne Horsley: And freeze.

Girl: Oh, my god.

Suzanne Horsley: You can see we have some left-over carbon dioxide. That’s kind of the way the situation is today.

Suzanne Horsley: So, they were able to see that there was carbon dioxide and that the trees were not able to fully absorb.

Suzanne Horsley: How does this carbon, how does that impact when we were talking about our cardiorespiratory system? How does that impact your health?

Girl: I think that if we don’t have all those trees, it would be much harder to breathe.

Sloane: If we have less trees, we will have less oxygen, and more carbon dioxide, and more people will be, like, getting more sick.

Suzanne Horsley: They saw the differences between life in the 1500s and life currently. Now that we know we’ve made this impact, what can we do as second graders?

Girl: Maybe you could, like, ride your bike to school or walk.

Boy: You can try to plant more trees.

Suzanne Horsley: When we teach climate change, students should be able to hear the facts and figures, but then they also should feel this agency, this ability to be actionable. And that helps with this anxiety and this worry because that’s there. That’s a given. It’s just how do we find ways to give students hope?

David: I do feel like that I can do something, like supporting groups that preserve the Amazon.

Margaret Wang: It certainly can be overwhelming for students because they’re the generation that’s going to be impacted the most. But teaching about it can actually be a powerful way to overcome that. Climate change is a multifaceted problem. By teaching about climate change across different subjects, students will be able to find their own personal connection to this topic and their own way of solving the climate crisis.

## Article

OpenAI’s large language model chatbot, ChatGPT , took the world by storm when it was launched in November 2022—and, nearly two years later, teachers are still finding creative, new ways to use the tool in their classrooms. There continues to be much debate: While some educators are concerned that the chatbot stifles learning by automatically outputting responses with no thought required on the part of the user, others are more optimistic about the tool. In fact, we’ve heard from a number of teachers who are using ChatGPT for critical thinking activities that help their students hone their analytical skills—and reckon with the limitations of the tool itself—in a fun and engaging way.

History teachers , for example, are getting ChatGPT to role-play as historical figures, from Cleopatra to Einstein. Their students interact with these digital imitations of figures from history, asking them questions and learning more about their lives. Then, students are asked to cross-reference ChatGPT’s output (which is often error-prone) with reliable external sources, fact-checking the AI and better understanding its tendency to “hallucinate” answers.

There are a multitude of ways to use the tool in English language arts (ELA), too. While some English teachers are trying out chatbots (of fictional characters) or using ChatGPT in writing lessons , others are having the tool output text that can be compared with famous works of literature—like Shakespeare’s sonnets or Lincoln’s speeches—so that students can better analyze the unique tone and style of various writers (and see how ChatGPT’s own tone tends to be quite bland in comparison). Edutopia’s assistant editor Daniel Leonard walks through these teacher-tested ChatGPT use cases—showcasing some prompts to try out, the kinds of responses educators can expect to receive, and how to use them to drive critical thinking in the classroom.

## Transcript

Daniel: Hi, everyone. My name is Daniel, and I am an assistant editor at Edutopia. And I wanted to make a short video showcasing an interesting classroom application of AI. So this particular tool probably needs no introduction. It’s ChatGPT. And what some history teachers are doing is getting ChatGPT to role-play as various historical figures. So let’s see how it does as Thomas Edison. I’ve asked it to imitate both his perspective and his manner of speaking. So now that we have AI Edison here, we can ask it a question like, “Mr. Edison, is it true that you stole ideas from Nikola Tesla?” And it says, we’re diving into the annals of invention and rivalry. Let me clarify. A complex relationship, differing visions. I’d say it’s doing a decent job at role-playing as Edison. It’s giving some context. But I bet the real Edison would have denied this question in much stronger terms. That’s my guess. But you can also ask it more basic biographical questions, like when and where were you born? And it’ll output a response. And so what history teachers are doing is having their students have these fun interactions with AI historical figures and then take the transcript of the conversation and fact-check it. “Using reputable online sources or maybe the class textbook, can you find anything that the AI said that is just outright factually inaccurate? Or maybe did it misrepresent something that the real historical figure would have believed or a perspective that they would have held?” Which really gets students to engage in critical thinking. Now, you can do something similar in English classes as well. You can have ChatGPT output a bit of text that is comparable to a famous work of writing. So in this case, I asked it to write a sonnet comparing a romantic partner to nature, which is comparable to Shakespeare’s famous Sonnet 18, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” So ChatGPT gives us a poem. It begins, “In fields where golden sun and shadows play, Thy love doth bloom like flowers in the spring,” etc. And so what English teachers are doing is, well, first of all, having students just make sure that this has the right rhyme scheme, structure, number of lines to be a sonnet in the first place, and then compare it to Sonnet 18. Even though they’re dealing with very similar subjects, and even though they’re both sonnets, they are very different in, most likely, in their word choice, in the analogies that they’re using, which helps students deepen their understanding of tone and style and why some authors, like Shakespeare, have gone down in history for having a beautiful style, and others, like ChatGPT, tend to fall a bit more flat. So hopefully this was a helpful look at some of the many ways that a tool like this can be used in the classroom, and if you happen to use ChatGPT in your class, we’d love to hear how you’re using it. Thanks so much for listening! Bye.

## Transcript

Teacher: What do we do when we have a problem? Ask?

Students: Three before me.

Teacher: When students encounter a roadblock, most of the time they can help each other rather than taking up my instructional time. So first they seek out help from another student. If that student can’t help them, they seek out another person.

Girl: I think it’s 59 Teacher: If they still can’t figure out the problem, they can look on the pacing chart in the back and say, this kid has already done this lesson, so this might be a good kid to talk with.

Boy: I don’t know.

Teacher: After that, they can come to me if their question hasn’t been answered. Did you ask three before me? It encourages cooperation and also autonomy. They’re capable of answering their own questions and knowing what to do if they can’t instead of always relying on an adult.

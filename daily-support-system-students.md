## Article

Fall-Hamilton Elementary identifies students who need a little extra social, emotional, and academic support, and pairs each one with an adult on staff who is not the child’s teacher. Students meet with their mentors for two minutes at the beginning and end of every day to plan their goals and then assess their progress using worksheets tailored by grade level . This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Fall-Hamilton Elementary .

## Transcript

Paydon: What’s that?

Mathew Portell: That’s another check in and check out of somebody who had the perfect day so we put it on the wall of fame. You gonna be the next one?

Mathew Portell: Because we do check in and check out, students feel supported through a positive relationship every single day, which builds their capacity to be successful students.

Emily Chadwick: I know you can do it, okay.

Mathew Portell: At the Fall-Hamilton, we’ve really put a lot of effort in building positive relationships.

Moriah: Hi Emily Chadwick: How was your day?

Moriah: Good Mathew Portell: One strategy we utilize is our check in and check out system, where adults are meeting with kids every single day and it’s not their classroom teacher. We have 41 students on check in and check out here. You’re gonna do great are you? We identify the students that just need a little bit more support where they’re struggling meeting some of their requirements on a educational level, but more of a social and emotional level as well.

Teacher: You did, I’m so proud of you.

Mathew Portell: The child knows every day they come in this building that somebody’s excited to see them in the morning and excited to see them right before they leave.

Emily Chadwick: Hey Moriah Moriah: Hi Emily Chadwick: You ready to have another great day today?

Moriah: Yup Emily Chadwick: My check in check out buddy, her name is Moriah and she’s in fourth grade. She has three goals everyday that she works on. What are your goals for today?

Moriah: Listen, be on task and nice.

Emily Chadwick: Awesome She can get zero, one, or two points for each of her goals.

Mathew Portell: The goal sheet is based off the student’s needs and it is agreed upon by the classroom teacher and the student. So whatever they’re struggling with is what the goal is set around. Then every increment of the day, at the end of a literacy block, at the of a mathematics block, at the end of recess, they’re just getting feedback.

Teacher: How about being nice? Do you think you’re a nice to everyone around?

Moriah: Yes Teacher: Good job, I agree you were doing a great job.

Emily Chadwick: Whoever the teacher is will give her points throughout the day. If she had a bad day, I try to just let her know that she still has a capability to do great tomorrow. But today was a really great day. You had a perfect day. She got a perfect score on her goals for the day.

Moriah: What I like about check in and check out that you get prizes and you get to see what you did good and what you did wrong and you can do better next time.

Emily Chadwick: We try to pick things that the kids like, school supplies, or non-tangible things like a positive phone call home to the parent congratulating them. It is a great day for Moriah isn’t it? So it’s not just about the points. The relationship and the accountability is really the important part.

Mathew Portell: How was your day?

Paydon: Good. Actually it was fantastic.

Mathew Portell: Fantastic!

Paydon: Mr.Portell, he’s our principle and my mentor. You go to him and them he asks about your day and if you had a problem somewhere, we’ll talk about that and see how you can fix it.

Mathew Portell: We’ve seen kids transform their own opinions of themselves. Paydon, man he had a rough year last year. Just to see his growth on a foundation level, being able to be in a class all day without incident and being able to start growing on his academics. So do you think you knocked it out of the park? That’s what I’m talking about. That’s been a huge success.

Paydon: You did it with me.

Mathew Portell: That’s right, no but you did it on your own. That’s you my man, nice work.

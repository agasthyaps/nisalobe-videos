## Transcript

Teacher: There are a lot of kids who sometimes fall into the background. The kids who are always just calm and quiet don’t always get the attention that the other kids get. One of the ways that I ensure every student’s voice is heard in the classroom every day, is by having an opening and closing circle. Meet me in your circle. We have circle agreements that have to do with respecting one another, listening to one another, being open to hearing what everyone has to say.

Student: Speak respectfully.

Teacher: What is your favorite thing to do with your family. I ask a question that has to do with family or life and we have a talking piece that goes around.

Student: My favorite thing to do with my family is spend time with them.

Teacher: Every child has a moment in the day where all eyes are on them.

Student: Watch movies.

Teacher: It’s a great way to build community. We get to learn things about each other that we wouldn’t learn naturally, just in the school setting.

Student: What I like to do with my family is going to the mountains and stuff.

## Transcript

Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: Consistency is really important for child development and for productive learning. The more consistency we have, the more the child understands what’s going on in the world around them, the more they can free up their brain from anxiety and really engage in learning. In Tacoma, what you see is a whole child approach with children and families and community organizations.

Dr.

Josh Garcia: The origin of the whole child initiative started from a basic principle that kids learn 24-7, 365 days a year, and if the adults could come together in our expectations, our supports, our language, in a unified manner, we would be able to make sure that every child was safe, engaged, healthy, supported, and challenged.

Karen Pittman: We’re talking about consistency of cues that let you know how to bring your whole self in to this setting and those cues let young people know that the adults in this space are on the same page as the adults in the other space, the more they will quickly settle in and be in that optimal space for learning.

Carla Santorno: So, it starts with a common vocabulary, so we all have to talk the same language, and it doesn’t happen by osmosis, so I can’t just say, “Zing! Let us all communicate and work together.” It means that you have to be very intentional, it also means you can’t do it all at once.

Dr.

Josh Garcia: What we needed to do is to identify two or three strategies that we could do across the system in order to create a common culture and a common community approach to this work.

Teacher: Good morning, how are you?

Karen Pittman: Warm greetings are a simple, powerful way to make sure young people know that they were seen and known and welcomed into a room.

Teacher: Go check into your zone.

Karen Pittman: Zones of regulation are important, because it allows young people to acknowledge the variation that they have in their feelings as they come into an experience.

Teacher: Thank you, friends, for checking into your zone.

Teacher: Please get ready for our morning mindfulness practice.

Karen Pittman: It also gives them an opportunity to acknowledge that they have responsibility for actually regulating those emotions.

Teacher: If your ever not in the green zone, please remember to use your tools and strategies that work for you.

Teacher: Where are you going to meet me?

Student: In the community circle.

Karen Pittman: Community circles are an important and easy way for young people to hear the complexity of their peers’ lives.

Student: Tomorrow’s Thursday and I get to– my brother’s first real basketball game and I left my charger– Karen Pittman: They really do give every young person an opportunity to say what’s going on.

Teacher: Hey, Falcon Center!

Students: Hey, what?

Teacher: Shake your booties!

Student: No way!

Teacher: Shake your booties!

Students: Okay!

Teacher: Jump!

Students: Jump, jump!

Fahren Johnson: There are onsite liaisons that connect in and out of school time. And, so, then over at Fawcett Elementary her role in the space is to ensure that providers understand the signature practices, Ven is really the connector of the two worlds and really oversees to make sure that we’re in alignment and we’re deepening those practices.

Venalin Aguilar: I am meeting with the principals and making sure that we’re using the same language as them and really just trying to bridge the gap between before school and after school so we can all be aligned.

Venalin Aguilar: We do check-ins to see what zone they’re in and then see if they want to talk about it.

Venalin Aguilar: Where did you check in today? Yellow zone? This is you, right? Why are you in the yellow zone?

Teacher: In and out. Too many things are happening.

Venalin Aguilar: We do our mindfulness breathing, exactly how the school does it, getting them ready for program.

Teacher: Hold hands! Form a big circle.

Venalin Aguilar: Participating in their community circles, the community circles, the mindfulness, the zones, you can tell that’s a part of their language, and then having it come from us, too, their like, “Man, everyone knows this.” Idris Joice: I want to know what zones you guys are in. Any greens?

Idris Joice: It keeps them on the same page so it’s not different, you know, when it’s different it kind of can get them, you know, like, “I’m confused, he’s saying one thing and then we go to school and they’re saying another thing.” And it’s, like, I like that everything is just cohesive, everything flows right. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: Children are getting developmental support everywhere that they are, having those practices everywhere creates a better community. These things create productive families, productive classrooms and productive schools.

Dr.

Josh Garcia: We want to make sure that every kid is whole, that they know that they live in a town where they’re loved, where they’re supported.

Carla Santorno: It’s a process and it takes time, but Tacoma is the beginning of what good communities should look like.

Students come to The Greene School in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, from all over the state to attend high school. Its unique campus and focus on environmental education brings in students from all different backgrounds and middle school experiences. Once there, teachers often have to recalibrate student expectations about what school looks like—and their role in their own learning.

Getting comfortable with active participation in discussions is part of that. “When I think about the portrait of a Greene School graduate, I think about students who are curious, who enjoy learning and feel a sense of obligation to contribute,” says principal Alex Edelmann. “And you don’t get to contribution through compliance.

I think you get highly successful people by building their sense of autonomy and helping them realize they’re powerful and that they have a lot to offer.” When students come to the school as freshmen, ninth-grade English Language Arts teacher Sarah Kristiansen helps students move from having a passive learning mindset to an active learning mindset. “We talk a lot about students being the leaders of their learning here. But we have to teach them how to do that,” says Kristiansen.

To encourage more students to participate, she regularly uses a strategy called web chats. She poses a question on the board, and then uses a marker to create a visual representation of the student conversation on a printout of the seating chart. After a few minutes, she pauses the discussion, shows students the map that makes their participation visible, poses a new question, and tracks the conversation again—this time with a different-color marker.

“By seeing that visual, they’re starting to see themselves represented with so many colorful lines, and the kids who didn’t participate are more likely to start in the next round.” Kristiansen is also mindful of introverted learners, noting that different students want to participate in different ways. Some students may need more encouragement, “but it’s important to me that they recognize that their voice is meaningful and important to the discourse in this classroom space.” To find more strategies for encouraging active participation in learning through discussions, read Andrew Boryga’s article for Edutopia, “ How to Rethink the Objectives of Classroom Discussion .”

## Transcript

Sarah Kristiansen: What is a collaborative conversation?

Student: You want to say things that contribute to the conversation and add on- Sarah Kristiansen: And add on. Good. And build. My students learn that their voices are the most important ones in the classroom as opposed to mine. They learn that I am not the only person who possesses expertise or knowledge, that that comes also from their peers. And I hope they recognize that their voice has meaning and value not only within these walls but outside as well.

Alex Edelmann: When I think about the portrait of a Greene School graduate, I think about students who are curious, who enjoy learning and feel a sense of obligation to contribute. That idea of contribution I think is so important. And you don’t get to contribution through compliance. I think you get highly successful people by building their sense of autonomy and helping them realize that they’re powerful and that they can learn a lot and that they have a lot to offer.

Sarah Kristiansen: I’m going to put a question up on the board that is a big, general open-ended question. We talk a lot about students being the leaders of their learning here, but we have to teach them how to do that. But it isn’t a debate because there really are no right or wrong answers. Today, in class we did a protocol called a web chat. And it is one way to move students into being responsible for their own learning, being those active learners. I post a discussion question. “Do you believe that our lives are controlled by fate or free will?” I give them a minute to jot down some of their own thoughts on that, and then I give them a time, usually five or six minutes, to discuss their answers.

Student: Our fate is basically written on how we use our free will and live based off of that.

Sarah Kristiansen: I step back. I usually sit at my desk with a map of the seating chart and then I track the conversation.

Student: I would agree with you, but I literally said the exact opposite.

Sarah Kristiansen: They are responsible for driving that conversation forward.

Student: Our lives are… It could be mainly controlled by free will, but I think there is a definite layer of fate to it.

Sarah Kristiansen: So after the first round is done, I show the map where we were. You can see there’s some back and forth responses to each other. And by seeing that visual, they’re starting to see themselves represented with so many colorful lines. There’s also a lot of people who don’t have any lines. And the kids who didn’t participate are more likely to start in the next round. How does believing in fate impact the way people make decisions or view their actions? In round two, I pose a different question. I give them, again, the minute of think time. And then the conversation begins again.

Student: Sometimes when people do horrible things, they just blame it on fate rather than their own free will.

Sarah Kristiansen: And I track it on the map with a different color.

Student: If you end up not believing in fate in your life, then your fate won’t happen to you.

Sarah Kristiansen: That round ends. I show them again, like, “Are we noticing anything different on the map?” Yes. More lines connecting to new initials on the board. And then we’ll do it a third time again with a different person starting it, a different color on the web.

Student: And it’s not the matter of fate, but it’s being at the right place at the right time and the right person.

Sarah Kristiansen: With introverted learners, it takes some encouragement to get them to jump in for the first couple of times because it feels really risky.

Student: If everything is fate, that means situations where it’s like you meet somebody out of the blue- Sarah Kristiansen: I really try not to stigmatize the introverted learners, that there are talkers, there are listeners. There’s value in both of those things. We don’t all want to participate in that same way, but it’s important to me that they recognize that their voice is meaningful and important to the discourse in this classroom space.

Alex Edelmann: It’s not about doing things because you have to, but it’s about doing things because they can see that it’s meaningful and they can see its value and they understand that the work that they’re doing is contributing to a better school or a better world.

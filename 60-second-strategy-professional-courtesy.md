## Transcript

Teacher: If I could have professional courtesy, please. Go ahead and put your machines at half-mast. Professional courtesy, it’s a call to every person in the space, for their eyes and ears to be focused, in that moment, on the teacher. And what professional courtesy looks like is computers are at half-mast, headphones are out and students are completely present with the teacher in that moment.

Teacher: If you guys can give me professional courtesy, you can half-mast your computers.

Teacher: Because so much of what we do is self-guided and students are really working on their own things so often, that makes the moments of bringing them all back really important. And we’re very intentional about explaining what that term means and the expectation associated with it. Ladies and gentlemen, please give your professional courtesy to your colleague.

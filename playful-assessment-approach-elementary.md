## Article

Years of experience and research have demonstrated that student voice, agency, and choice play critical roles in the classroom, but when it comes to assessment, they often fall by the wayside. At Pierre Elliott Trudeau Elementary School (PETES), in Gatineau, Quebec, third- and fourth-grade language arts teacher Fiona Medley, who is committed to using music and movement as learning strategies in her lessons, intentionally brings a playful approach to her assessments as well. As a result, her students experience less worry and are more self-assured—and they look forward to showing her what they know.

## Transcript

Student: I’m a big kid that goes to high school.

Student: One day, I woke up and found out I’m a small kid.

Fiona Medley: Because I make assessments playful, I find that my students have a greater sense of achievement in what they do. They feel a greater sense of pride, greater sense of success, and a lot more fun. They don’t get the same nervousness. There’s no anxiety. There’s no stress. We’re all here learning together, which is the point, right? In the fourth-grade class, we were working specifically on conjunctions. We’re thinking about the link that joins two sentences together, right? I wanted them to be understanding the concept of making a connection. And the bridge that joins them together, well, that’s our…?

Students: Conjunctions.

Fiona Medley: Our conjunction. We take a look at some examples of how we use conjunctions, and then I set them free to explore conjunctions on their own. You are then going to decide which conjunction you will use. They were in groups of three, and they had to write two simple sentences that could be joined together with a conjunction. OK, fantastic, there you go. And I gave them a packet of conjunctions that they were able to decide which conjunction that they wanted to use. So in that assignment, I’m actually giving them a lot of choice. I am not telling them what sentences they have to write. I’m not telling them what conjunction they have to use. There is a lot of exploration there.

Student: I love my black dog— Student: But I also like my cat, Candy Cane.

Fiona Medley: I find that with this kind of idea, they get to see, like, oh, yes, this is how I get to use “and” or “yet” or “so,” and it doesn’t always have to be the same conjunctions. It allows me to figure out where the class is—if I need to review this lesson, or if I need to go about it a different way. Do you think “and” is the best conjunction to use? Hmmm.

Student: It’s not an actually— Fiona Medley: I’m looking at, OK, are they understanding the concept? Are they adding their ideas? Are they actively listening? Are they getting started right away? Are they on task, or have they gone on a tangent? So, we are going to take our presentation positions. The presentations were just a lot of fun. But it allows them to solidify their learning. Because they get to present their sentences with a group, they’re not alone. So we’re taking away all the fear.

Students: I like to sleep in after school, so that’s what makes me late in the bus in the morning.

Fiona Medley: Fantastic. It also allows them to take a lot of pride and feel a sense of achievement with their learning.

Fiona Medley: In the presentation, it also allows me to assess, did this group get it, or did they not get it? They go away with a solid understanding of conjunctions, which they can then use in their writing.

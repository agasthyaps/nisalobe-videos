## Article

Third- and fourth-grade teacher Fiona Medley, at Pierre Elliott Trudeau Elementary School (PETES), in Gatineau, Quebec, has a great brain break that brings her learners back to attention when they get restless—she writes action words on Popsicle sticks and draws them as prompts that allow students to explore how to move to the word written on the stick. “[Jitter sticks] are a great way for students to expend their energy and for teachers to focus the students,” Medley says. “The movement really activates their brains.”

## Transcript

Fiona Medley: It’s time to break out our jitter sticks. Today we are going to fly.

Medley: The purpose of jitter sticks is basically brain activation and body movement. They’re a great way for students to expend their energy and for the teacher to focus the students. I get all of the words onto little Popsicle sticks.

Medley: You are gliding.

Medley: I pick the stick with the action word on it and explore how to move to that word. It’s kind of freedom of expression. I have them go through with a count of eight that action and then introduce the next word. And I would do that for about four or five words.

Medley: Melting.

Medley: The moving just really activates their brains. The jitter sticks really help because the students are able to focus their energy, and they’re a lot more ready to learn.

Medley: Beautiful. Well done.

## Article

The virtual learning social story featured in this video was written by Courtney Daignault and Whitney Listman and published by Transcend Education . Transcend offers a whole collection of downloadable social stories for educators, free of charge. The concept of social stories was developed by Carol Gray in 1990 for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); they have since found broader usage.

## Transcript

Courtney: This story is about our time together on our laptops, and on our computers. And it’s about Virtual Learning.

Courtney: Social Stories are books that address routines, rituals, and desired behaviors for children.

Courtney: Learning from home feels very different from being in school with our teachers and friends.

Courtney: It lays out the sequence. It gives them expectations. “I have a routine, and this is what my routine is going to look like.” Courtney: Got it, got it!

Girl: Got it, got it!

Courtney: So the story of Virtual Learning, we began thinking about what the children might be wondering. When I sit down in front of the computer or a device with my teacher, I’m going to be greeted. we might sing a special song together. We might do a mindfulness moment together. These are the things that I might need during my special time with my teacher on that given day.” This year, given that we were not able to capture photographs, we had the opportunity to work with an illustrator. In the event of not having an illustrator, we might find images on an online platform. There’s so many resources now that access images and that could correspond with the text.

Courtney: I am sharing a story with you today on Virtual Learning and what that time of day is going to look like.

Courtney: So we then sent the story to all of our families. I taped myself reading the text. I emailed it to the families.

Courtney: See how this girl, she is working with her teacher on her laptop.

Courtney: And then my partner teacher and I revisited the story again, reading it with them in the context of our virtual small groups. And then that story lives on our virtual platform, so that children can read about it on their own time as well.

Courtney: When I noticed that perhaps children are needing some support, we can refer back to the story. We’ve developed Social Stories for Individual Children. Addressing a certain behavior where they might be having challenges during their school day, we can create a Social Story just for that child. It gives more time for actual teaching and facilitating and fostering instruction. It makes the learning time given on a virtual platform just more efficient and more effective.

Courtney: Teachers will help us do our best no matter where we are!

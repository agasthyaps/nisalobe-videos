# Creating a Culture of Caring Through Student-Led Service Learning

> When older elementary students take the lead on community service projects, they gain public speaking skills, leadership experience, confidence—and younger students are more motivated to participate.

At Lawrenceville Elementary School in central New Jersey, the CARE Kids are famous. The CARE (Children Acting Responsibly Everyday) program started two decades ago when a group of students wanted to do more for their community. It has since grown into a schoolwide program in which all third graders spend the year leading the school’s community service projects.

“Our CARE Kids, our third graders, are really our ambassadors of service learning,” says school counselor Melissa Wall, who coordinates the program. CARE Kids take on six to seven projects during the school year, from food and clothing drives to autism awareness activities to creating cards for local seniors. Each project starts with a read-aloud: Small groups of CARE Kids visit the younger grades, read a related story to them, and then do a short pitch about how students and families can participate.

“I think it really is a benefit for our younger students to hear from our older students,” says Wall. “They listen to their teachers and their parents all day long. But to hear something from someone who’s just a little bit older than you, who you might look up to as a role model, you know, really has a powerful way of influencing them.” Teachers incorporate the projects into their classroom activities and make cross-curricular connections (for example, students might do writing assignments related to the book the older students read aloud to them).

Third graders also get to incorporate math standards, as they calculate donations and create bar graphs to represent participation. As a result of the program, CARE Kids graduate from elementary school with a real sense of pride and accomplishment. In addition to the warm and fuzzy feelings they get from supporting their community, CARE Kids gain valuable leadership and public speaking skills for the future.

## Transcript

Melissa Wall: So we begin our service learning with our youngest kids because it’s important to build those skills of empathy and kindness and compassion when they’re young so that as they grow it becomes innate. And that’s really what we’re doing here. We’re trying to build good citizens and kids with good character. Student 1: We are here to ask for your help in collecting backpacks and school supplies for students in need.

Melissa Wall: Lawrenceville Elementary School is just a wonderful little family. And that’s really our mission is to create a building where our families and our students feel a strong sense of connection. And so we have lots of social-emotional initiatives that are really at the forefront of what we do.

Melissa Wall: The CARE Kids program started over 20 years ago with a small group of students who wanted to make a difference in the community, and it has grown to every student in third grade.

Melissa Wall: Our CARE Kids are really our ambassadors of service learning, and they take their jobs very seriously.

Ben: I feel sort of warm and fuzzy inside when I get to help people and teach kids to care. And it’s just pretty fun.

Melissa Wall: Some of the projects that the CARE Kids have led this year include coffee sleeves for our Kindness Week, two food drives, education about inclusion during Autism Awareness Week. Our latest project is a backpack and school supply drive.

Ben: Everyone deserves the chance to learn and have their school supplies to help them. Student 2: Daddy’s back-to-school shopping adventure.

Melissa Wall: The CARE Kids had the opportunity to read a story about back-to-school shopping, which hopefully got them thinking about all the things on that list and how hard it might be to have the money to purchase all those things.

Ben: Get ready to put some pep in your step, my little pickle quackers. Today we’re going back-to-school shopping. And what’s my number one rule for school supply shopping? We only buy what’s on the list.

Romley: Then we ask them, what can you donate? Student 3: Please donate any of the following new school supplies: crayons, markers, glue sticks. Student 1: What do you think you might be able to donate? Student 4: A backpack and a pencil. Student 5: Markers and crayons.

Melissa Wall: I think the CARE Kids really benefit from presenting to the younger students. They gain leadership skills.

Keya: You get to conquer your fear of standing in front of a bunch of people. Student 6: Then we passed out coloring sheets of a backpack and got to help color it.

Melissa Wall: The younger students really benefit from seeing someone who’s just a little bit older than you who you might look up to as a role model. You know, really it has a powerful way of influencing them.

Ben: We help them learn about kindness and help them help others.

Gia: I want to be a CARE Kid when I go in third grade, helping out people. It makes me feel happy.

Melissa Wall: We will count up all of the donations that we received and create a bar graph in the hallway so kids will be able to see the number grow. They’ll also be able to estimate how many donations we’ve received.

Melissa Wall: So beyond service learning, they’re also getting some math and literacy connections as well.

Romley: I hope that we get lots of school supplies, because I like helping.

Keya: If I got one of the backpacks, I’d feel loved and happy.

Melissa Wall: Because of the CARE Kids program, our students learn that they have the power to spread kindness and to really make a difference in the lives of families and students in our community.

## Transcript

Teacher: Okay, so I would like to close the loop for the session. What happens in a recession, guys? Closing the loop is basically the end to the session. We don’t want the kids to abruptly go onto the next class. We want to understand whether they’ve understood the concepts, and so we close the loop with reflection. Maximum seven minutes would be my closing the loop time for a session. So I ask them, first of all, the key takeaways.

Student: So price levels fall, and as a result, cost of raw materials eventually fall.

Teacher: Then they would have reflective questions about how the class went. What was the toughest thing or what was the easiest thing? What was the easiest, Turananja?

Student: The effects of the policies that the government makes?

Teacher: And why was that making sense to you most?

Student: Because we’ve already looked at the formula a couple of times.

Teacher: How were we as a class today? Were we attentive, were we not really attentive? Because we have a lot of metacognitive questions, they become more self-aware.

Student: That’s what my question is.

Teacher: Closing the loop helps me in terms of understanding my students, and also how to plan my next session.

## Transcript

Teacher: We’re going to start with a traverse and we’re going to have a couple of different discussion points that you’re going to talk about with different partners. A traverse is a tool for facilitating talk. The first thing we would do is, children line up and face each other. You could give a talking point and then they discuss. First talking point, wheelchair users can’t play sport.

Student: I disagree, because– Teacher: Partner A needs to say something and then partner B responds, and then partner A feeds back. And then the traverse moves along, so they work with different partners after that. Our next talking point is, boys shouldn’t wear pink or play with dolls. Off you go. Traversing works really well for making sure children have a range of different talk partners very quickly. Developing that ability to speak and to question and challenge is really important.

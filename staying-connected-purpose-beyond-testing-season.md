It’s just that the system is crushing them with “You have to do test prep all the time.” So by saying, “You should take some time to help kids develop into great human beings, you should take the time to help them do some things they are proud of,” what you’re really doing is saying, “Take a moment to do what you got into this profession for in the first place.”

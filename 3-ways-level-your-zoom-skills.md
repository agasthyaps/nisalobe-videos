Narrator: For many teachers, Zoom is the new classroom, at least for any kind of synchronous teaching. Trainings and support should cover the basics, but if you’re ready to take your students’ engagement to the next level, with interactivity and collaboration, here are three ways to bump your Zoom game from passing to pro. For nonverbal, whole class feedback, physical hand raising is simple, but emoji reactions are a little more fun. Students can click to show thumbs up, hearts, clapping and more, right from the bottom toolbar. To check for academic understanding, or emotional wellbeing, pose a question and have students respond in the chat. As the host, you can adjust settings to ensure the chat is being used effectively. Set it so participants can chat with you only, with everyone publicly, or with anyone on the call. Pro tip, ask a student or co-teacher to monitor any public conversation. If there are questions or technical issues, you’ll know about it in time to shift your strategy. You’ll find a variety of features for collaboration and learning within the screen share tool. Once you’ve shared your screen, you can open an annotation toolbar that allows you to write, draw, highlight or stamp on any screen you’re sharing. You have the option of limiting annotation to the host only, or letting everyone join in. And you can either hide names or show them, to see who’s contributing. If you’d like to start with a blank slate, choose the whiteboard option when you first share your screen. Then your class can use the annotation tools on an empty page. And best of all, you can save the results of the work as a PDF. One way to get students to work together remotely is by using breakout rooms. These can be a challenge to manage, but offer and opportunity for face to face collaboration. For projects or small group discussions, you can assign students automatically, manually, or let them choose. Make sure directions for the task you’ve assigned are posted in chat. Once students are in rooms, they won’t be able to see the main Zoom screen. There’s a button students can click to ask for help while in a breakout room, which notifies the host that the room needs support. If you’re concerned about keeping students on task, you can always drop into rooms to check in. All of the more advanced features will be easier with a trial run first, so enlist a colleague to help you level up to Zoom expert status before you try it live.

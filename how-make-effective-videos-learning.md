Narrator: Instructional videos are powerful tools to enhance student learning at home. They allow students to learn at their own pace, and free up time for teachers to support students individually. But too often, they lose their effectiveness because educators make common mistakes. Research has found that videos are often too long, too confusing, too unengaging. Avoid common pitfalls by following these five tips. The longer the video the less likely students will pay attention. Research shows students start tuning out after about six minutes. Instead of having one long video, think about breaking a lesson into short segments. Too much text onscreen can overwhelm students. Instead use visual cues like arrows to indicate key concepts and diagrams to help explain ideas. Students learn less when they listen passively. Throughout the video encourage students to reflect and take notes. Check for understanding by incorporating questions and short quizzes. Organize your video into chapters. That way, student can find a section quickly when reviewing materials. Students will be more engaged if the video feels authentic. Use a casual tone and speak encouragingly. And remember to just be yourself. Make students feel like they are in your classroom.

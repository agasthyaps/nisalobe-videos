This video is part of our series on rapid resets , tools for de-escalation that can help teachers and students build resilience, calm their nervous systems, and bring their thinking brains back online. Special thanks to Resources for Resilience , an organization in Asheville, North Carolina, that trains educators in how to use these tools for themselves and with their students.

## Transcript

Ann: So one rapid reset is called take a sip, and it’s so simple.

Ann: So if I’ve got a student who I think might benefit from a rapid reset, almost always if I can, I want to do that with them. Maybe we both have a water bottle, and so I will say, “Let’s both have a sip and see what we notice.” Ann: I might say, “Is your water cold today? Is your water kind of plain or does your water have any flavor?” Ann: I might just model it and say, “My water today is so nice and cool and refreshing. Ah, it makes me just take a breath, makes me relax. How about when you take a sip?” Ann: I’m not making them do something. I’m just like, getting curious with them, what it’s like to take a sip. A lot of talking is not going to get me very far, so I’m not going to say a whole lot, but “Let’s get water. That water tastes good.”

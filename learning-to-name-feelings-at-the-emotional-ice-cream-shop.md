At The Co-op School in Brooklyn, New York, a simple game of pretend becomes a powerful tool for building emotional vocabulary—an important step in promoting self-regulation among very young children. “Emotional Ice Cream Shop” invites students to practice recognizing and learning to name feelings, while acting them out in a playful way. Here’s how it works: One child selects an emotion—silly, sad, or angry, for example—and acts out that emotion while ordering ice cream at the shop.

The shopkeeper, often the teacher, mirrors the emotion back while the rest of the class observes. As pre-K teacher Holly Van Duyne, who uses the game in her class of 3- and 4-year olds, explains, “We play Emotional Ice Cream Shop to facilitate students learning different emotions and how to express them to themselves and their peers.” Some students jump right in with expressive acting, while others need more direction. Van Duyne adapts the game so that younger children feel supported, while some students stretch their vocabulary with more nuanced feelings like frustration or disappointment.

Van Duyne will often help children choose from several options, and she models what those feelings look and sound like. This makes the game accessible to all students, no matter their starting point. By embodying emotions through play, students begin to recognize and verbalize them with greater accuracy.

As Van Duyne notes, “There can be a lot that they’re not able to express, and emotions can present as different things. So having the language can help them verbalize more descriptively how they’re feeling.” The game brings out lots of laughter and dramatic performances while the students are learning, and gives the teacher a chance to let students see another side of them. “I think it helps me be a little bit more silly,” Van Duyne says.

“And having games like Emotional Ice Cream Shop in my back pocket are really helpful in order to hold the group’s attention.” In the pretend ice cream shop, students are not only expanding their emotional vocabulary as they learn how to name feelings, but also practicing empathy, self-expression, and connection—skills they’ll carry far beyond preschool and kindergarten.

## Transcript

Holly Van Duyne: All right, friends. We are going to do a little emotional ice cream. I’m going to pick a friend. You are going to pick an emotion. We play emotional ice cream shop to facilitate students learning different emotions for their vocabulary and how to express them to themselves and their peers. I’m going to start with Francesca. You’ll have a student come up and you are the ice cream shop person, and you can either ask them to pick an emotion or you can pick the emotion, whether it be angry, sad, silly. I’m asking you to pick one now.

Francesca: Sad.

Holly Van Duyne: Sad. OK. And the whole tone of the conversation is landed in that emotion. Hi, how are you?

Francesca: Hi.

Holly Van Duyne: Oh, hi. Are you here for some ice cream?

Francesca: Yes.

Holly Van Duyne: Yeah. What kind of flavor would you like?

Francesca: Chocolate chip.

Holly Van Duyne: And they’re really good at coming in with a sad vibe or a silly vibe and kind of imbibing that in the acting.

Francesca: Vanilla.

Holly Van Duyne: Vanilla. OK. And then anything else? And I like to mimic that to them. Did that make you happier? Sometimes for this age group, they need a little bit more direction. So, we did excited, sad, silly. Do you want to do mad, frustrated? Which one would you like? Because the age range is from 3 to 4, it can be quite a difference, but I think it’s important for those on the older end to be able to have a little bit more range and understanding for different vocabulary.

Student: Angry.

Holly Van Duyne: You want to come in… ooh. And then we will ask them if they’ve ever experienced that feeling, whether it’s disappointment or frustration, in order for them to consistently be given different types of emotions to add to their vocabulary. Take your ice cream. Thank you. There can be a lot that they’re not able to express, and emotions can present as different things, so having the language can help them verbalize how they’re feeling. Friends, give yourselves a round of applause. Everyone did a beautiful job, a wonderful job.

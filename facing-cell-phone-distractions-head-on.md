“I just think positive reinforcement is important,” says Fairview High School social studies teacher Jess Quiggle. After years of battling phone use in the class, Quiggle has come up with a simple but effective system, which incentivizes students to put away their phones—and neatly cuts down on cell phone distractions. “I’ve been teaching for 16 years, and cell phones have always been at least a little bit of an issue, just like note passing was when we were in high school.

Since Covid, though, the shift has been dramatic. It’s no longer that cell phones are a privilege. Their cell phones are so attached to them that it’s like a right,” she says.

The school’s recent cell phone policy allows students to have their phones at school but prohibits them from taking their phones out during instructional time. Quiggle found, though, that students were still distracted by their devices, even when they weren’t actively in use. This year, as students enter her classroom, they have the option to put their phones in a numbered shoe caddy (each pouch corresponds to a student).

At some point during the class, she or her teaching assistant put stickers on a chart of student names, one for every kid who’s turned in their phone. Once a student has 10 stickers, they can trade those in for a homework pass. Kids can use the pass when they’ve failed to do an assignment (or have done it poorly), so that it won’t negatively affect their grade.

While participating is not mandatory, more and more students are seeing the benefits of separating themselves from their phones. ”This year is the most compliance I’ve had. I don’t have kids trying to sneak it. I don’t have kids trying to grab their phones on the way out the door to go to the bathroom.

They seem so willing and eager to give it up that they don’t even think about it once they put it in.” And while the homework passes are definitely a motivating factor, kids report other benefits as well. ”I think there are more cons than pros in terms of cell phones in schools because it distracts the kids more than it helps them,” says 10th grader Samuel, who likes Quiggle’s new system. “I think the buzzes in your pocket can really just knock you off your concentration and get you to lose your focus in class.” To hear what other schools are doing to mitigate the challenges of cell phone distractions in the classroom, read Paige Tutt’s article for Edutopia titled “ 3 Schools, 3 Principals, 3 Cell Phone Bans .”

## Transcript

Jess Quiggle: When kids have their phones out, it just makes you feel kind of futile. It doesn’t matter how much you’ve prepared, how engaged you are, how cool your lesson is, whatever is happening on their phone is more interesting than anything you have to say, and it’s honestly defeating after a while. Since I came up with this cell phone policy, my students are more able to focus on what I am asking them to do in a day. It just removes that distraction for them. I’ve been teaching for 16 years, and cell phones have always been an issue. Since COVID, though, the shift has been dramatic. I think having that year where they weren’t around people at all made them so desperately in need to be connected. The idea of being told to put their phone away just became an affront.

Student: It’s such an addiction. It’s very hard for me to not look at my phone every single second of the day.

Jess Quiggle: So the current cell phone policy is that students are not supposed to have it out during instructional time. I take it a step further and say, “I don’t want them on your person.” If they’re on you, you’re going to think about them, and so we just need to put them out of sight, out of mind. So I have developed a system.

Jess Quiggle: Welcome. I have a numbered shoe caddy that’s hanging on my wall.

Student: Whatever number you are, you put into the caddy.

Student: It’s optional if you want to put your phone in there or not.

Jess Quiggle: Either me or my TA puts a sticker on a chart for every phone that’s in the caddy.

Student: And each 10 stickers is one homework pass.

Student: Since I have so much stuff after school, if I can’t do the homework, then I can just give her the pass, and then I can get a better grade on it than I would’ve.

Jess Quiggle: The first map that we’re going to look at is a political map. The borders, the roads, the towns… Student: I think she came up with that policy to just make sure that kids are staying engaged in her class. I like it a lot because it is really distracting just having those little buzzes in your pocket.

Jess Quiggle: Once they realize how much better they focus without the distraction, they’re much more willing to give it up. Since I came up with this, I have not reprimanded a single kid for cell phones. The kids are constantly hearing negative consequences and negative feedback, and it’s nice just to be a little understanding. I just think positive reinforcement is important.

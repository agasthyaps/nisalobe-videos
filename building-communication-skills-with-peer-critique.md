## Article

At Whiting Lane Elementary School , in West Hartford, Connecticut, all students are held to a high standard for presenting their ideas—and they receive direct instruction and support in order to be successful in building communication skills. In a fourth-grade classroom, curriculum specialist Karen Bridges leads students through a feedback activity where they have opportunities to practice in trios, using a rubric to give thoughtful, productive critiques of their classmates’ presentations on local history. The school prides itself on creating safe and supportive learning environments, so a foundation has already been laid that allows students to feel comfortable in sharing their works-in-progress with each other.

The students take turns actively listening and rating their peers on clarity of speech, confidence in body language, and quality of their accompanying slide decks. An anchor chart with sentence stems for both positive feedback and constructive criticism is posted on the wall of the classroom, giving structure to the conversation to ensure that it is helpful. The results are tangible: better, more polished student work, stronger communication and public speaking skills, and importantly, a deeper sense of shared responsibility and ease with collaboration within the classroom community.

“I want students to feel that sense of pride in their work and to feel a sense of pride knowing that I’m also helping a friend, a peer, to improve what they are doing,” says principal Karen Kukish. “I know that it’s my responsibility as part of that classroom family to exchange my thoughts and ideas with my classmates.” To try this activity (and adapt it for any subject), download the peer feedback rubric as seen in the video, developed by Whiting Lane fourth-grade teacher Dawn Beckley. It’s meant to be printed as two-sided and cut in half.

## Transcript

Student : You had confidence, body language, stand tall, quiet body. Bridges : Because we offer opportunities for peer feedback, our students are able to speak out about different thoughts and ideas that they have, and they’re able to support each other, and that’s very important. Student : Try speaking louder next time. Kukish : We are focused on academic achievement and high levels of rigor. We instill grit and a growth mindset in our students, but it’s relationships that are at the core. You matter. What you think and what you say matters to me, and I want to hear from you. And I know that it’s part of my responsibility as part of that classroom family to exchange my thoughts and ideas with my classmates. Teacher : Connecticut Research, you have been working so hard on it. In fourth grade, the students were working on researching Connecticut. Student : There are many things to do in West Hartford, including visit its seven beautiful parks. Bridges : The students have been working to collect information from multiple sources, synthesize that in a way that they could share, and present that information in a cogent manner with other people. So today, I wanted them to present in small groups to practice and get feedback, so they could see what areas they had to strengthen, what areas they needed to work on. We’re going to be active listeners, we’re going to be constructive feedback people. I start with our objective of, we’re here to polish the work that we have, as well as practice public speaking. Again, we’re going to be using our rubric. I wanted to remind them how to use the rubric, and then with an anchor chart that gives them sentence starters, so that they can communicate in a way that’s constructive and positive and complete. Student : The park is open from sunrise to sunset. You can’t pick flowers or disturb plants. Student : The English in the old days were colonists and wanted to take over the Wampanoags’ land. Bridges : After everyone had presented, that’s when they would read through the information they were given, and then they could process it, and they could actually ask their teammates for more information if need be. Student : My partner said that it was too kind of like choppy, and I was reading it too fast. Student 2: I gave you two. Student 3: Confident body language, because you were moving your foot a lot.

Student: It kind of hurt my feelings, but it’s more on the more positive side. It would help me speak more clearly, and not choppy. Bridges : And they were able to have a good, respectful discourse in that. Student 3: I could understand what you were saying, because you spoke clearly and slowly. Student 2: You had a very supportive pictures and spoke clearly. Bridges : Peer feedback is really important, because they hear from the teacher all the time, and after a while they might very well tune it out, but if they hear it from multiple sources as well of their peers, who they respect and value, they’re going to internalize it quite a bit more. Student : His slides were easy and neat, so I gave him a five. Kukish : I want students to feel that sense of pride in their work, and to feel also a sense of pride in knowing that not only am I doing my work and my job and my project, but I’m also helping a friend, a peer, a classmate to improve what they are doing, and I’m giving them that valuable feedback, and they’re accepting it and making changes in their own presentation. Student : Great pictures for slides, and very good language. Something to try next time, try to talk a little bit louder next time.

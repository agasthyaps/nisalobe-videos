## Article

In Frederick, Maryland, third-grade teacher Karen Wills is beginning a lesson on finding claims in a text with her class at Sugarloaf Elementary School . “Yesterday we read the text Edison’s Best Invention , and then today they had to identify the claim within that text,” she explains. “But I knew that prior to them identifying a claim, we really needed to see what they knew about a claim.” So Wills planned an activity to help her students tap into their prior knowledge.

Wills begins by asking students to independently jot down their own ideas and definitions of the word “claim” from memory—a tried-and-true retrieval practice activity. Then Wills walks the whole class through a word mapping exercise where she collects all of the students’ ideas up on the board before finally sharing the definition found in their textbooks and revealing that the two closely match. Learning Science Partners ’ Jim Heal explains why this practice is so effective.

“The teacher could simply have defined the word on behalf of the students. Instead, what the teacher did was invite those learners to create a word map to make their own points of reference.” This process allowed the group to arrive at a collective understanding of core terminology and gave Wills a chance to address any misunderstandings in real time. To further reinforce the concept, Wills then asks her students to sort out statements into two categories—claims and not claims—an exercise sometimes called examples and non-examples .

As they work in pairs, Wills circles the room, probing students to explain their thinking. Additionally, she challenges them by asking how they would change a statement to make it into a claim, another step in the lesson that Heal cites as an excellent way to solidify students’ understanding. “‘What would have to happen to this phrase in order for it to become a claim?’ is an excellent question to ask,” he says.

“In order to answer, students must rationalize their thinking, and in so doing, they’re making explicit their own definition of why a claim is what it is.” When Wills connects her students’ prior knowledge to the current lesson through a series of simple but highly effective activities, she sets the stage for a deeper understanding of the core concepts they were learning that day—and beyond. This video is part of our How Learning Happens series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Karen Wills: Now let me ask you a question. Have we heard the word claim this year?

Students: Yes.

Karen Wills: Absolutely, right?

Dr.

Jim Heal: In any lesson, there are core terms and ideas that every student must understand in order to be successful in that learning. The teacher needs to be certain that the core information, terminology, or ways of thinking about an idea are consistently and evenly understood within the class.

Karen Wills: Listen to what I’d like you to do. Open your learning composition book to the next clean page, and right smack in the middle, put the word claim . Yesterday we read the text Edison’s Best Invention . We talked about how it’s an opinion text. We went through all the different things about opinions. Today we’re going to talk about the word claim . And so then today they had to identify the claim within that text. But I knew that prior to them identifying a claim, we really needed to see what did they know about a claim. I want you to put your thoughts about the word claim on your paper. I asked them to jot down an antonym or a synonym or a sentence, anything that jogged their memory when they think about the word claim . Don’t worry if you don’t have a lot, we’re going to keep adding to it. And so they’ll stop and jot whatever they were thinking. Then I wanted to pull together their thoughts, and so I created a map up on the board so that we could put some of those thoughts together and kind of start to talk about the words.

Student: It’s, like, what the story is mainly about.

Karen Wills: OK. What the text is mainly about.

Dr.

Jim Heal: The teacher could simply have defined the word on behalf of the students. Instead, what the teacher did was invite those learners to create a word map to make their own points of reference. It also enabled her to see whether or not there are any real-time misconceptions or misunderstandings of the term.

Karen Wills: In our curriculum, they say that a claim is a position an author takes on a subject. What the author believes, the author’s point, the author’s opinion.

Dr.

Jim Heal: And it also allowed the group to arrive at a collective understanding of some core ideas and terminology.

Karen Wills: I’m going to ask you to put what you know about a claim to the test. After we made the map together, I asked them to sort different opinions or claims. Look at that paper. What’s the first column say?

Students: Claim.

Karen Wills: Everybody, what’s the second column say?

Students: Not a claim.

Karen Wills: Inside your Ziploc bag, you have exactly that. Claims and not claims. And look at the eight or nine different statements and decide were they claims or were they not claims and to talk about what they thought.

Student: Broccoli is a green vegetable that grows in the garden.

Student: Claim. I mean not claim.

Student: Claim.

Karen Wills: I also challenged some of the kids. Could you add a word to make this sentence an opinion?

Student: Everyone should build Legos on the weekends.

Karen Wills: Oh.

Student: That’s an opinion, get it?

Karen Wills: Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

Dr.

Jim Heal: Asking students, “What would have to happen to this phrase in order for it to become a claim?” is an excellent question to ask. In order to answer that question, students must rationalize their thinking. In so doing, they’re making explicit their own definition of why a claim is what it is.

Karen Wills: Hey, boys and girls, pat yourselves on the back. Wow, that was incredible.

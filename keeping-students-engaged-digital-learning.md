Narrator: It can feel like a big change, but online teaching is still teaching. Your virtual classroom will need to be managed, and you will still need to teach responsibly and differentiate your instruction. Yes, there will be some adaptations, but setting norms, cultivating belonging, and making your curriculum compelling, those are still at the core. Here are six tips from seasoned veterans for keeping students engaged in a virtual environment. Try making your own digital content, like videos or slide decks, but stay laser-focused on keeping instruction clear and simple. The research says that being your natural, authentic self is another key here. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes and let your personality shine through. Navigating virtual spaces can be confusing, and you don’t want students missing critical info. Be sure to have one central hub where all the latest updates go. You can create other spaces like chatrooms or lounges for group discussions or side conversations. Virtual learning doesn’t need to be chaotic. Share clear expectations for participation, respectful interactions and dress code. Ask students to design agreements together, to ensure every voice is heard. It will help them stay focused, empathetic and kind. You may not all be in the same room, but students should feel a sense of community, so make time for small group work and relationship-building activities. That keeps the humans behind the texts or video screens connected. Giving your students some space to learn independently builds critical skills, but they’ll need support too. Set online office hours, so your students know when they can reach you. You should also participate in discussion threads and offer guidance and encouragement regularly. Research shows students retain more knowledge when they’ve actively engaged with materials. Keep learners from becoming passive observers by finding ways to build in polls, break for brainstorms, or drop guided questions into the instruction.

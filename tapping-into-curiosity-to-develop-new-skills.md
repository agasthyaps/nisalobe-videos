# Tapping Into Curiosity to Engage Teens in Challenging Content

> Using topics students care deeply about can leverage their natural interest to encourage them to develop new skills and content knowledge.

One of the tenets of The Greene School in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, is to make learning meaningful and relevant for their students. So while teachers certainly take state standards and content requirements into account, they also get to know their students well, in order to capture their curiosity as a means to develop knowledge and skills. In a school devoted to environmental stewardship, many of the students have an interest in both climate issues and social justice.

When first-year AP Statistics teacher James Bailey was tackling scatterplots, random samplings, and least squares regression lines, he used something the kids found compelling and cool as an entry point: the Tree Equity Score . “It shows the canopy or the coverage of trees in all the different blocks in the urban areas of the United States,” says Bailey. “There’s all different statistics that you can layer on top of it—like you can look at poverty, you can look at race, and you can look at all the different things that a general census would collect.” Tapping into the students’ natural interest and asking them to work with data in their own neck of the woods—Providence, Rhode Island—made them more willing to try their hand at working through challenging materials.

“I chose this because I knew they were familiar with the area. So I figured this is a super-cool tool to start to dig into environmental justice.” The Greene School’s principal, Alex Edelmann, sees it as schools’ job to expand the bank of what students care about while helping them develop new skills. She says, “That idea of fostering curiosity is partly about showing that they can understand difficult things, that they can take on difficult topics, and that the learning can be their own.

Even though there are these state standards that we have to cover, that doesn’t mean that the learning can’t be applied in a really rich and relevant way.” For more ideas on how to make math more relevant and centered in the real world, read Sarah Gonser’s article for Edutopia, “ Will Ditching Calculus Make Math More Relevant? ”

## Transcript

Alex Edelmann: I think curiosity is about expanding that bank of things that you care about and that idea of fostering curiosity is partly about showing that the students can understand difficult things, that they can take on difficult topics and that the learning can be their own. Even though that there are these state standards that we have to cover, that that doesn’t mean that the learning can’t be applied in a really rich and relevant way.

James Bailey: All right, welcome everybody to AP statistics class. Today we’re actually going to be looking at some really cool real world data right from our backyard. This is actually my first year teaching AP statistics, so it’s a great challenge for me to deliver it in an understandable and approachable way for my students and then also to develop some interest in it. And that comes from really getting to know your students first. Many of The Greene School students really care about the environment. I chose this because I figured this is a super cool tool to start to dig into environmental justice. Student 1: In this lesson, we will be looking at the data available in the tree equity score analyzer.

James Bailey: We have an amazing instructional coach and she introduced that tree equity score website to me. It shows the canopy or the coverage of trees in all the different blocks in the urban areas of the United States. There’s all different statistics that you can layer on top of it. You can look at poverty, you can look at race, and you can look at all the different things that a general census would collect. And the one that we’re really going to be looking at today, guys, is people in poverty. And the whole idea is to be able to take statistics and to take the tree equity score and target our resources most efficiently for planting trees. For instance, the one that I clicked has a tree equity score of 85, and if we look here, people in poverty, 39%. So we were looking at Providence, Rhode Island. We’re going to be looking to see if there is some overall trend between those two. Next, I had the kids create a scatter plot and they had to locate all of that data on their own, and the goal was to create a random sampling, so they had some representation from each part of the city. Student 2: I noticed that in the east side, they had the highest tree equity number. Student 1: But the southern side is such a low score.

James Bailey: They took that data and then they fed it into a statistical software that is used to create scatterplots. Then they used the least square regression line to create a line that best fits the data and they were using it to make a prediction in the dataset. It’s called interpolation. Student 2: I feel like you’d think that if you were poor there’d be less trees, but that’s not the case. Student 1: Yeah.

James Bailey: It’s not this clean artificial dataset. There was a lot to interpret. So as the tree equity score is going up, what’s happening to our value? Student 3: It’s decreasing.

James Bailey: It’s decreasing. Student 1: People in poverty are going down.

James Bailey: People in poverty are going down and they would notice that yes, it’s a linear relationship, but it’s not super strong. Student 1: I didn’t think that the tree equity rate was directly linked to the amount of poverty. When you see high number, there’s definitely lower poverty rates, but it’s not always like that in all the parts of the town.

James Bailey: Trying to think more of the actual context of the problem itself and not just the math. That’s a huge part of AP statistics is always referring to the context of the problem. Maybe there’s a better way to link these two with the tree equity score and it might be population density.

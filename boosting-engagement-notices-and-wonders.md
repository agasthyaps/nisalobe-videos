# Boosting Engagement With Notices and Wonders

> When students make “I notice” and “I wonder” comments on course content, teachers can see what they know—and what they need to learn.

## Transcript

Ann Young: Take a look at your graph.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: In most classes variability is the norm, not the exception.

Ann Young: We’re going to be doing an “I notice, I wonder.” Dr.

Pamela Cantor: This teacher is aware that these children learn at different paces and so she is creating a mechanism to see the developmental starting points of a diverse group of kids so that children can move at different rates to master the content.

Ann Young: This classroom is heterogeneously grouped. This is a non-tracked class. Some kids will be bypassing Algebra One next year and going into an advanced class and some kids will be taking a pre-algebra class. So, there’s a wide range. Today’s graph had a lot of information in it and, so, it was perfect for an “I notice, I wonder.” Ann Young: What is this graph telling us? What do you notice in the graph? Don’t do the “wonders” yet, just your “notices.” Take about two minutes.

Ann Young: The “I notice, I wonder” helps kids slow down and really focus on what’s in front of them. They wrote about what they noticed and then turned and talked to a neighbor to enhance and to draw attention to things that they maybe had missed.

Student: Renewable energy aren’t being used as much.

Student: Yeah. Seems to be going down actually.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: The information she is getting is about the individual variability in that classroom. What the kids are getting is the benefit of learning from each other.

Ann Young: All right, let’s get a list of “I notice, and I wonder”.

Student: I noticed that petroleum had a big jump in the 1900s.

Ann Young: What’s another “notice”?

Student: I notice this is a monthly energy review.

Ann Young: Oh, so, you’re looking below the graph as well as above the graph. Awesome. All right, let’s switch over to the backside and I want your “wonders.” What do I wonder about this graph?

Ann Young: The “I wonder” is a great way for me to see what they need to know.

Ann Young: So, what do you wonder? Oh, my gosh, so much to wonder about.

Student: I wonder what the other renewables are.

Ann Young: It’s also a time when you can build confidence in kids.

Ann Young: Great question.

Student: Yeah.

Ann Young: Yeah, I agree with you. Aidan?

Aidan: What is BTU?

Ann Young: What is a BTU? Great question.

Ann Young: “I notice, I wonder” just brings the conversation to a place where all people can contribute. It gives everyone a voice. It allows kids to listen to other people’s ideas before they do the analysis. So, it’s like a way to collect information collaboratively, but allowing time to think first.

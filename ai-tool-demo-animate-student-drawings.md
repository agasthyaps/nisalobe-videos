## Article

Young students love to draw—for many, it’s one of the first creative passions they develop. At the same time, animated TV shows and movies loom large in the cultural consciousness of most young learners. So what if it were possible to combine the two in the classroom?

Imagine the possibilities of an app that could animate student drawings at the touch of a button. A new AI tool from Meta called Animated Drawings is helping to make that dream a reality. When provided with a photograph of a sketch—as long as the sketch has a human-like pose, with four limbs and a head—Meta’s artificial intelligence (AI) can quickly identify the figure’s appendages and, within seconds, convert it into over two dozen different short, looping GIFs.

A child who draws a four-eyed, winged monster, for example, can quickly see what it would look like if the monster knew how to tap-dance, jump rope, or perform judo moves. In this short demo, Edutopia’s assistant editor Daniel Leonard explains how to access and use this new tool—and shares some of the ways that pre-K and early elementary teachers are using it to drive learning in the classroom. For example, some teachers have noted that primary school students—who love creating drawings to input into the tool—have improved their pencil grip over the course of the year as a result.

Others say that their students have improved their draftsmanship, too, as they’ve noticed that the AI gives better results if they’re able to give it a figure that’s more precisely human-shaped (and less abstract or squiggly). Meanwhile, other teachers have used the animations as a jumping-off point to have their students engage in creative storytelling around their original characters. To read about other fun ways teachers are deploying AI in the classroom—from using AI-generated images as writing prompts to having students converse with AI imitations of historical figures—check out Leonard’s feature for Edutopia titled “ 9 Tips for Using AI for Learning (and Fun!) .”

## Transcript

Daniel Leonard : Hi everyone, my name is Daniel and I’m an assistant editor at Edutopia. And I wanted to make a short video showcasing a fun AI tool for early elementary students that I came across in my reporting. So this tool is called Animated Drawings. It’s from Meta AI and it does what the name suggests. The first step here is to upload a drawing. So I have this little robot drawing I did. I took a photo of it on my phone and then emailed it to myself so I could have it on my desktop here. So we’ll open up that and hit next. And the first thing the AI does is try to identify the borders of your image. You might have to adjust it a bit like I had to do here and then I’ll hit Next. Now it’s identifying the exact contours of the figure you drew. It gives you some tools to adjust it if need be but usually does a pretty good job. And finally it tries to identify the exact limbs and head of the image—a few seconds later, I have an animation of my little character here, and it offers I think 32 different animations. There’s one that’s kind of fighting moves, kind of flying kick. That’s cool. There’s definitely some dancing as well. Here’s one kind of doing the wave. And so I hear from teachers students really love seeing their drawings come to life like this, and there are some learning outcomes that you can tie it to as well. My mom is a pre-K teacher, and I hear from her that her students love this tool and that it’s helped them to develop their pencil grip as well as their draftsmanship. For this tool to work, you do need to provide it with a figure that has four limbs and a head, and so for students in her class who are maybe a little bit more abstract and scribbly in their drawings, they’ve gotten better over the course of the year because they really want to see this tool work, and they know that for it to, they need to be more precise in their drawing. This tool is also fantastic for getting early elementary students to develop their storytelling capabilities. You could ask the student, “Why is your character running?” “Is it running from something?” “Is it running to somewhere?” and really get them to kind of engage in creative imaginative storytelling around their original character. So we wanted to showcase this fun little tool, and if you know of other fun AI tools that are out there, definitely let us know. All right. Thanks so much for listening. Bye.

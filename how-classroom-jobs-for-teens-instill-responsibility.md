## Article

Meredith Howard, a history and social studies teacher at Albert Hill Middle School in Richmond, Virginia, sees the many benefits that come from teens taking on classroom jobs. But her initial inspiration was straightforward: “It was simply a time saver and a job saver for me so I can put more of my energy toward actually teaching.” At the beginning of the school year, Howard demonstrates all of the jobs during the first couple of weeks. Then, she asks interested students to apply to one or more jobs, citing their skills that would make them especially successful.

Someone in charge of helping absent students, for example, needs to have excellent attendance. She then assigns students to various jobs, which they keep for the entire school year unless they retire (Howard has never had to fire anyone). Within a few weeks, students conduct their jobs without being asked or reminded.

It relieves Howard of administrative tasks, and it promotes a classroom that flows smoothly from one activity to another. Before the bell rings, the Whiteboard Manager updates the whiteboard with that day’s agenda, learning targets, and homework. Then, the Attendance Monitor announces the attendance question of the day and counts off.

If anyone is absent, the Absent Helper collects that day’s handouts and writes the student’s name on them. Though this is more common in preschool and elementary settings, Howard is a big proponent of assigning classroom jobs to older kids and teens. Secondary students are capable of taking initiative, keeping track of tasks, and reporting information accurately.

And they take their responsibilities seriously. Beginning early in the school year, their peers begin to rely on them to deliver graded papers, check that they’ve written down the homework correctly, and sing to them on their birthdays. The result?

A classroom culture in which everyone contributes—and everyone takes ownership of their learning. Download a list of student jobs and their descriptions from Howard’s classroom. The PDF also includes a draft of her application form.

## Transcript

Meredith Howard: Couriers, could you pass out papers, and then we’ll get started. Everyone else, take out your step sheet. Because I have student jobs in my classroom, my classroom flows really smoothly. They’re really nice, easy routines that I can rely on, and I have a stronger classroom community of students who really feel like they belong and they have ownership in their class, too. All right, thank you couriers. Appreciate you. You are missing out as a secondary teacher if you’re not doing student jobs. The older kids are capable of doing more. For the time you put in the first couple of weeks teaching students how to do this job, it runs itself for the rest of the year. Student jobs are usually assigned in the first couple of weeks. They fill out paper applications for me, and they tell me why would they be qualified for this job? What skills do they have?

Franny: I said that I know everybody’s name in the class, and I can read messy handwriting. So… Meredith Howard: The first job that’s happening in the background is the whiteboard manager. As soon as they come in, they know to pull up our learning management system and see what I have posted digitally on our agenda, and they are to update anything as required. They also change my date.

Student: The attendance question of the date is, would you rather be able to fly or be able to become invisible? One?

Student: A.

Student: Two?

Student: B.

Meredith Howard: My attendance monitor will ask the attendance question of the day and call through the numbers, and they mark in my paper book who is present, who is not. OK, Nora, so Garrett’s absent. Can you get copies for him as Absent Helper? Thanks. Anyone who is absent, the Absent Helper is meant to collect sheets throughout class, put that student’s name on it, the date that they were missing, and they are also meant to be a resource. If you’ve been absent, you go to that person first instead of me. Oh, what a lifesaver. Every day in class, we write in our agenda what our learning targets are, our homework, etc. We’re done with our agenda. So, Agenda Checkers, raise your hand, everyone, for a check, myself included.

Olivia: I’m making sure that they have all that Ms. Howard wrote down because I feel like if you don’t know the schedule, you won’t know what you’re supposed to do for the day. If you don’t have your homework written down, you’ll forget that you even have homework to do.

Meredith Howard: I just had too many things to do that were not related to teaching. I want to celebrate birthdays, but I just couldn’t remember and commit to it, and so, I have a Celebrator job, and when that birthday is today or near, stop everything and sing.

Student: 1, 2, 3.

Meredith Howard: A kid can do this. In fact, the kids love to do this, so it’s a really good example of a student doing a job probably better than I would do, and they’re reminded to do it on their own. They want to do it on their own. For my students who perform the job and the students who are not performing jobs, you have someone else in the class that you can go to if you need something. We’ve got the community aspect and holding people accountable and developing trust with one another and owning your experience in the classroom.

Nora: I think it teaches responsibility and leadership. I think it’s just helpful, because it makes you more independent, and it gives you an opportunity to help other students.

Meredith Howard: It really becomes like we are all in this together. It’s not just my classroom, it’s their classroom. It’s their learning experience. They’re a team that makes this whole thing work.

Student: Yeah.

Meredith Howard: Couriers, if you could pass out the stuff in the wire basket. Thanks.

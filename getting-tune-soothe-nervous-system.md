## Article

This video is part of our series on rapid resets , tools for de-escalation that can help teachers and students build resilience, calm their nervous systems, and bring their thinking brains back online. Special thanks to Resources for Resilience , an organization in Asheville, North Carolina, that trains educators in how to use these tools for themselves and with their students.

## Transcript

Another rapid reset is sing a song or hum. When we sing or hum, we feel a little more expanded, our breathing and airways open up, we might notice some vibration in our throat or in our face. Let’s say I’m the teacher and I’m feeling a little bit activated. I’m about to flip my own lid and I might have the whole class sing. The fancy word is attunement, we’re attuning. Maybe it’s just two students who really need it right now, but I’ll just have the whole class do it, because why not? Everybody who didn’t need it just got a little break for their nervous systems. And then the two kiddos who really did need it, they didn’t have to be called out, or…it’s like we’re all just going to do this. I’m going to model how it helps me. So singing in groups can be a really nice way to settle a whole room in a positive way. So singing is like exercise for the nervous system. The stronger our nervous system is, the better we can control our fight or flight response.

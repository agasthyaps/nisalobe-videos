## Transcript

Mickey McDonald: There are three activities. One’s a sorting sentence activity. One is an online interactivity. And one is small group that’s going to be working with me. McDonald: I wanted a way to be able to work with students while other students are still engaged in content learning.

Student: X equals 4.

Farah: Yes. Whoo.

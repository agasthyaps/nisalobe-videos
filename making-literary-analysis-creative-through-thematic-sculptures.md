# Making Literary Analysis Creative Through Thematic Sculptures

> When students build a sculpture that represents their thinking as a form of literary analysis, they grapple with texts in new ways.

## Article

Karla Hilliard, an English teacher at Spring Mills High School in West Virginia, is a big believer in play. “Play can be purposeful,” Hilliard says, “and there are lots of reasons to play.” It’s a break, it’s a way for students to connect, and it’s a way to deepen their literary analysis skills—that’s why she introduces her students to a playful activity she calls thematic sculptures. Hilliard selects a text that has “some layers and some complexity for students to dig into.” During a class period, she reads it out loud, and then gives students a chance to read it on their own and annotate the text.

They highlight the text and make notes about the style, structure, craft, and literary devices. During a poetry unit, Hilliard will introduce multiple poems to students, and each student picks their favorite. In the next class period, Hilliard gives students a chance to review the text and discuss it with a partner.

Then, she announces, “Let’s play!” She instructs each student to produce a sculpture that represents a major theme of the text. Students choose to work with Play-Doh, Lego bricks, or both to create their sculpture. They’re encouraged to talk with their classmates, exploring together how to best represent the text.

Hilliard rotates around the class, asking students to explain what they’re making and why. Crucially, the text itself and the prereading materials stay on the desks, and Hilliard prompts students to identify text evidence that supports their sculpture design. Once students have made their sculptures, Hilliard asks them to write a note card explaining their sculpture.

Students include an interpretive title, akin to a title for a music album or a painting in a gallery. They also write a description of their sculpture, explaining to their classmates what they made and why. Everyone then participates in a gallery walk, viewing their classmates’ work and seeing new interpretations of the text they read.

The activity concludes with either an exit ticket or a turn-and-talk, spurring students to reflect on one of their classmates’ interpretations. Hilliard notes that students “never end where they begin” as they build their thematic sculptures and dive deeper into literary analysis. The familiar materials of Legos and Play-Doh empower students to let their guard down, flex their creative muscles, and express their ideas in a hands-on, playful new way.

## Transcript

Karla Hilliard: Lexi, what’d you make?

Lexi: I basically made the family eating at the dinner, and then there’s going to be an empty seat for the dad since the dad’s gone now.

Karla Hilliard: Good.

Karla Hilliard: Because my students make thematic sculptures, they create something that’s representative of their thinking and deepen their analysis and their understanding of a text.

Karla Hilliard: Think about maybe something you can add that sort of captures… Student: The deeper meaning.

Karla Hilliard: Yeah, a little bit more. OK. Keep going.

Karla Hilliard: The mission of Spring Mills High School is to give every student a great student experience, to make sure they feel included, loved, and valued. I want them to feel excited about learning. And so, adding the additional layer of play is just so closely connected to what I believe as a teacher.

Karla Hilliard: Give me a thumbs-up if you know the poem that you’re going to work with today. Give me a thumbs-up. So what you’re going to do is play with Legos and Play-Doh today. Hooray! You are going to work with these materials to demonstrate an interpretation of the poem you selected. You’re going to grab some Play-Doh, grab a cup of Legos, take it back to your desk, and make something awesome.

Student: Based on the poem I read, I was going to make three people.

Karla Hilliard: I see students begin with, “What am I going to make?” They’re focused on their product. And then as they start working with their Play-Doh or their Legos and they’re considering the representation of their ideas, you can see their thinking grow and evolve.

Student: I’m making an orange, but in flames.

Karla Hilliard: I love it. So tell me why.

Student: It says “Someone might have thought I was making a fire in my hands.” Karla Hilliard: Good. Can you think about how that connects to his experience? Just think about it.

Student: OK.

Karla Hilliard: OK.

Karla Hilliard: As they’re building and creating, and I’m encouraging them to return to the text, they just continue to deepen their analysis and their understanding. They never end where they begin, and that’s the cool part about it.

Nirya: At first, I did not know what I was going to do at all. I don’t know how to make this a little deep. I kind of started rereading it and thinking about it a little more and I was like, “Oh wait, I understand what to kind of do now.” Karla Hilliard: I really want to know more about your peeled orange.

Nirya: I think it might represent him opening more up to this girl probably.

Karla Hilliard: I love that.

Nirya: Yeah.

Karla Hilliard: They have to write an explanation about what they’ve made, why they made it, and figure out a way they can clearly and cleanly explain to their classmates what their sculpture is.

Karla Hilliard: All right, guys, are we ready to gallery walk? We’re all going to stand up and then just make your way around the room.

Karla Hilliard: A lot of times some of the quieter students have an opportunity to share their voice and their thinking and their insights with their classmates that maybe they ordinarily wouldn’t have offered.

Student: It’s really good.

Student: Yeah, very good. Very good.

Nirya: Writing an essay can be a little hard to find your understanding with that. Otherwise, with a sculpture, it’s more fun, it’s more open, and it also helps you look deeper into the text.

Karla Hilliard: Once you feel like you have seen the class gallery, go ahead and return to your seats.

Karla Hilliard: And then the cherry on top is some sort of exit ticket, or you could just have them turn and talk and crystallize their learning about their poem or someone else’s poem.

Student: I really like the fire.

Student: Yeah, I like Erin’s fire.

Karla Hilliard: Play, for me, builds community. It lowers the pressure for students who feel uncertain about their interpretations. And so when you put something in their hands that they can use to create something that’s representative of their thinking, I think we are accomplishing a lot.

Karla Hilliard: Please put away your Play-Doh and Legos. Thank you so much for your hard work.

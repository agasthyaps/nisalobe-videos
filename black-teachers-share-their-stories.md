## Article

To learn more about the research shown in this video: In 2017–2018, nearly 80% of public school teachers were White; 7% were Black. (Sources: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 2020 ; U.S. Census, 2019 ) Students who feel they belong are more likely to be motivated, self-confident, and academically successful. (Source: Korpershoek et al., 2019 ) In public schools nationally, more than half of all students are non-White. (Source: NCES, 2020 ) Black teachers are more likely to report feeling discriminated against and disrespected in their schools, and cite these as reasons to leave the profession. (Sources: The Education Trust, 2016 ; Learning Policy Institute, 2018 ) Black men are particularly underrepresented in the teaching profession, making up less than 2% of U.S. teachers. (Source: U.S. Dept. of Education, 2016 ) A 2018 study found that Black students who had a single Black teacher were 13% more likely to enroll in college. (Source: Gershenson et al., 2018 )

## Transcript

Will: Growing up, I may have seen three or four Black teachers and I didn’t have any of them.

Montenique: In Florida, it’s very rare to see, like, a Black teacher, a Black doctor, a Black lawyer. So I struggled trying to see myself in, like, educated people.

Jonathan: A very vivid memory that sticks with me… I walked in on the first day with my little uniform and my backpack, and I was really excited. I was the only person of color in the classroom. I remember thinking very clearly, “I am different.” Montenique: I always longed for a teacher that looked like me, who I could confide in, who, like, understood where I was coming from. So part of what I wanted to do is help, you know, African-American girls who are kind of searching for the same thing. Like, I wanted to be that person. Jonathan : At my college, that was the first time I’d had someone standing up in front of me that looks like me. And that was really transformative and a big reason as to why I wanted to enter the classroom myself, and kind of give back.

Will: I was married. I started having kids. And you always come to that question, what’s the lasting impression you want to leave? Looking at my kids, I kind of figured out, I just want to be an influence, where maybe I haven’t had those influences in my life.

Jonathan: I didn’t come into the classroom knowing, kind of, all the statistics. I kind of came very bright-eyed and very bushy-tailed, just thinking, oh, I want to teach. Very, very quickly you understand, the stakes are really high for Black and Brown students who I get to see every single day.

Will: A lot of students, they don’t want to talk to you. You’re told to stay quiet, stay low, stay humble. So most of them have a hard time, just opening it up and talking about, just anything.

Montenique: Sometimes, like, I’m able to sit down with kids and, like, really talk to them. And those are, like, always my favorite moments because I come from a really, like, rough background. And so, you know, it’s always, like, surprising to kids to hear, like, oh, this teacher who grades me, she has a similar background and if they’re ready to talk, they’ll come talk, and if they don’t want to talk, they don’t. I get that. Will : I never tell people what I do. Usually, being a Black man, no one’s expecting me to be a teacher, so I’m usually disrespected on the daily. And when they find out I’m a teacher, you can see the respect level change, they act and they talk to me differently. I kind of find that part disrespectful, that you would change the way that you talk to me just because of what I do. Montenique : I’m very proud of the fact that I’m a teacher. And depending on who I’m talking to, I feel either really, really good about it, or like, okay, you guys can stop talking about it now. People do seem shocked sometimes to hear that there is a Black person who’s educated, who teaches children.

Jonathan: The impact that I’m making is going to be slightly different on my kids, than the impact that some of my colleagues are going to make. But also, like, it’s a responsibility that I sometimes am not always, like, aware of how to navigate.

Will: You have to make sure you uphold your integrity every single day. Even though sometimes I might want to get mad at something small, where another teacher may get mad at something small and it’s acceptable for them, all those students are looking up to me and looking to see what you do in situations. But it’s good to see that what I do and say may have a lasting effect on someone else’s life.

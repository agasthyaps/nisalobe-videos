## Article

At every grade level, math teachers in the Success Academy Charter Schools Network in New York City ask students to spend the lion’s share of their time during math lessons deeply examining the question they are being asked to solve. Students start by asking themselves questions like, “What are the mathematical relationships in the problem?” “What is this problem asking me to do?” and “How can I model my thinking?” Every classroom even has a formula—a problem-solving plan for math, printed out and displayed on the wall—called the “Plan of Attack,” which includes three parts: using 80 percent of the allotted time to conceptualize the question by reading the problem multiple times, then modeling the relationships and actions in the problems; 10 percent to answer the question by determining a strategy they will use to solve it and then computing; and finally double-checking in the last 10 percent of their time—by rereading the problem, evaluating their own reasoning, and checking computations for accuracy. First-grade teacher Evelyn Gonzales and eighth-grade teacher Fei Liu both reinforce this strategy during precious class time by working through the problem as a whole with their students first, emphasizing the importance of this step before rushing in to solve.

As a result, their students develop a much stronger understanding of the mathematical concepts at hand. “In my classroom, I don’t really care for the answer,” says Liu. “They can double-check once they have the answer.

What we really need to focus on is why we set the things up, so that when they see a problem, they have an idea of where to start to think.” The network led the state for math test scores in the 2023–2024 school year, with with 49 percent of Black and 55 percent of Hispanic students earning fours, the highest possible mark.

## Transcript

Fei Liu: When we have three variables, is two equations enough to solve for it? No, right? We say no and he tells you no, but let’s actually look at why it’s no.

Fei Liu: One of the biggest things I see when a kid sees a math question is you put a number on a page and you just start doing. Math is not just doing the numbers. It’s about explaining what the numbers mean and coming up with an idea of a story so you can get a result.

Fei Liu: So if we read a little bit more of the question, it says that Dan has three less dollars than Pam.

Eva Moskowitz: We find it incredibly productive when the children visualize mathematical relationships. You don’t start computing until you know what is going on in the problem. You have to model that out.

Fei Liu: We’re going to go ahead and open up today’s problem.

Eva Moskowitz: We spend a lot of time on just the problem. What is the problem about? What are the mathematical relationships? Can I conceptualize?

Fei Liu: So this is why we need the third equation. This is why sometimes when we do it, we need to make sure we read the question all the way through.

Fei Liu: A kid should spend about 80 percent of their time conceptualizing the question. What is the question actually asking you to do? How do I set it up correctly? How do I look at it? How do I model my thinking?

Fei Liu: The first statement says together that Pam plus Dan plus Sam has $31.

Fei Liu: How do I in some way, shape, or form put down what I am thinking in my brain on a piece of paper?

Lauren: You develop a plan in your head, and that way going through the question, going through the problem is much easier for you.

Fei Liu: You’re going to read through the four questions, decide whether you can use elimination and substitution, and then try to execute on two of those questions.

Fei Liu: And after that, the other 20 percent is actually doing it. So executing on whatever you develop and getting an answer, and then double-checking.

Student: Shouldn’t you subtract it the other way around?

Student: Yeah, subtract this one from this one.

Evelyn Gonzales: It is time for number stories.

Evelyn Gonzales: The plan of attack in math for first grade is similar to the plan of attack in every grade here at our school. We follow the 80-20 rule, which is 80 percent of the time they are conceptualizing the question, 20 percent of the time they’re answering the question and double-checking.

Evelyn Gonzales: How many pages did Katey put stickers on?

Evelyn Gonzales: For first grade, we spent the 80 time on the rug together.

Evelyn Gonzales: So as we’re working together on the rug, we’re going to be rereading the problem, we’re going to model any actions that we see throughout the problem that we have today.

Evelyn Gonzales: We go sentence by sentence, and we try to picture the action that’s happening, and together we start creating a big story of what’s happening with those stickers.

Evelyn Gonzales: Katey had 35 stickers. She put five stickers on each page of her sticker book.

Evelyn Gonzales: The plan of attack does help them understand that it’s not just about reading the question and answering the question. If they are taking that time to read the question multiple times and reason through the question and figure out the actions in the story, then the answering portion and the double-checking can easily be done.

Fei Liu: From here, we’ll get an answer of negative this, and whatever the Y is equal to. I’m not really worried about the answer right now. I’m really worried about the reason why we chose elimination.

Fei Liu: And this is why, in my classroom, I don’t really care for the answer. They can double-check once they have the answer. But what we really need to focus on is every minute in class, truthfully talk about why we set the things up so that when they see a problem, they have an idea of where to start to think.

Student: Three minus four. It’s true. You got it?

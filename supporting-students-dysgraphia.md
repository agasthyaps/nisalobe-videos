## Article

Compared to other learning disabilities like ADHD and dyslexia, dysgraphia is not well understood. But we do know that for children who have dysgraphia, it can be a serious obstacle to academic success—and the research suggests there are tactics you can adopt to help kids with the condition express themselves. We looked at several sources for this video, including the understood.org website, “ What Is Dysgraphia? ” by the National Center for Learning Disabilities, a 2007 study titled “Dysgraphia: How It Affects A Student’s Performance and What Can Be Done About It” by Alyssa L.

Crouch and Jennifer J. Jakubecy, and 2015 research from Peter Chung and Dilip R. Patel published in the International Journal of Child and Adolescent Health .

Narrator: If a student has difficulty writing, it may be a sign of dysgraphia. Compared to other learning disabilities, like dyslexia and ADHD, dysgraphia is not well understood. There’s just not a lot of research yet. But we do know that for children who have dysgraphia, it can be a serious obstacle to academic success. According to the National Center for Learning Disabilities, dysgraphia can impair a person’s ability to write, spell, and put thoughts down on paper. The condition may be characterized by strong thinking skills, but weak writing skills. And there are signs you should look out for: difficulty gripping a pencil, slow, labored writing, poor spelling, irregular letter sizes and shapes, inconsistent spacing, and a mix of upper- and lowercase letters. It’s easy to forget about dysgraphia and dismiss poor handwriting as just sloppy or lazy. But that’s a real problem. Students with dysgraphia may already suffer from low self-esteem, high stress levels, and difficulty forming friendships. So, what should teachers do? First and foremost, be supportive so that students are encouraged to work on their handwriting. Teachers can also provide large pencils or pencils with specialized grips. Let kids use tape recorders, speech-to-text software, or computer keyboards to capture their thinking. Give additional time for writing assignments and tests. Consider assigning alternatives to writing, such as oral reports, and help students practice motor skills by playing with clay, for example, or tracing letters.

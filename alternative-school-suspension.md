## Article

Conflict resolution is a key aspect of Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School’s approach to infractions that previously might have merited in-school suspension. In the school’s restorative circles, counselors guide students to recognize the impact of their behavior on their peers and the school as a whole. This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School .

## Transcript

Rashida Fetuga: First I’m gonna read a quote. To succeed, you must first improve. To improve, you must first practice. Young people have to be given space to grow and to feel like, okay, I made a mistake but from this learning experience I can continue to become better. To learn, you must first fail.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: When you’re talking about student discipline a lot of times we are punitive because it’s faster and restorative takes more time. But restorative practices are better long term. So at Pearl Cohn, we have a place called the Zone which we use in lieu of suspension.

Rashida Fetuga: Welcome to the Zone.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: It’s a collaborative space where kids get into a circle and they discuss what their behaviors were and ways to correct it.

Rashida Fetuga: We have the Zone every morning from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m..

Student: They put you back in the same situation. And then they expect Rashida Fetuga: Today, we had eight students in the Zone. We’re here today to talk about how to make things right when we make mistakes, poor choices, uh Usually the infractions are cell phone use, disrespect, cursing, but it could also be that there was an argument in a classroom or more aggressive behaviors that also get sent to us. So even though you had a conflict that brought you here, if we can bring our best selves to the circle we can get a lot done, we can learn from each other When students come in we go over circle guidelines so that there are agreements that we hold within this space. What does it mean to listen from the heart?

Student: You’re tryin’ to feel like you’re relatin’ to the situation.

Student: Just like, show respect to them. I talked toabout the situation, about my phone situation.

Jamel Gooch: Once we teach them, really what the Zone is and how this is not a space where there’s a power dynamic between you and another person, then they kinda disarm and get to what’s causing that behavior.

Timesha: I had somebody come to me and tell me that a friend said something bad about me… Most the time when you’re in trouble you get a referral and you have a consequence. They don’t really wanna hear your side of the story.

Rashida Fetuga: Well what happened?

Timesha: When you come into Zone they have a conversation with you and they kinda tell you how to solve your problem. The positive way. I was able to go to her and like, work it out.

Jamel Gooch: We’re really just trying to get context. Whenever there’s a conflict right, both parties contribute to the conflict. Although you might not feel like you contributed to the problem, you played a piece in it, and that’s a part of the social-emotional learning that we’re trying to get them to see. We really want to have a discussion about the things you can control.

Student: I just need to catch myself and know my surroundings… Rashida Fetuga: It is a place for students to process their role in it, understanding who was harmed, but then also understanding that it’s okay to reflect on what you as a student needed in that situation.

Student: I don’t need anything from others to make it right cause I can be mature on my own.

Jamel Gooch: But how can we help you in the maturing process? Cause we gonna be here too. What I usually say is I don’t want to change you’re behavior, I want you to think about it before you do it. Really I’ve seen them becoming very intentional about what they do, what they say.

Student: Everybody has to own up to their consequences Jamel Gooch: And that’s the whole purpose of the Zone.

Student: And me ownin’ it, that’s gonna help me better.

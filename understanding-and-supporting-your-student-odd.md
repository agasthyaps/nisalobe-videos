## Transcript

Narrator: Students who behave with unusual aggression, frequent temper tantrums, excessive arguing, and mean and hateful speech, may be struggling with oppositional defiant disorder. Kids with ODD exhibit a pattern of uncooperative and hostile behavior toward authority figures, including parents and teachers. If you’re not familiar with the symptoms and strategies to help, it can be highly disruptive and even a little scary. Your natural instinct may be to react defensively, but this can backfire and create a power struggle. For kids with ODD, an empathetic teacher who understands them and helps them deal with the issue, instead of calling them out in a negative way, can be a lifeline. Try to shift your focus from recognizing negative behavior to acknowledging positive behavior. Send home a note, for example, when students show improvements, even if they’re small gains. Create opportunities for students to tell stories about their lives, and actively listen when they do. Figuring out factors that contribute to an outburst and identifying triggers may help you avoid some negative situations. Strong connections will influence behavior in the classroom, but will likely not prevent outbursts altogether. Help students learn to recognize mounting feelings that lead to defiance. Look for signs of escalation, like balling up fists, withdrawing from classroom interaction, or clenching their jaw, and create a safe reset space where the student can take a break and rethink their choices.

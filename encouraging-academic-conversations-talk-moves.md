## Article

Teachers at King Middle School in Portland, Maine, make these sentence starters easily accessible by taping a talk moves printout to students’ desks. King Middle School developed these talk moves inspired by Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades 1–6, Second Edition, written by Suzanne H. Chapin, Catherine O’Connor, and Nancy Canavan Anderson (Math Solutions, 2009).

This video is part of our How Learning Happens series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Catherine Paul: These are the keys to participating in a conversation fully.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: Sometimes we all need a little bit of a kick-starter to feel like we can contribute. Children are going to struggle a bit, depending on how confident they feel, in speaking up in class. And yet this teacher wants everybody in the class to feel valued. So the kids are all learning phrases that can inspire other kids to contribute more easily.

Catherine Paul: We’re trying to build a conversation here that is a community of caring and respect. So look at your talk moves on the table today, and I have a post-it note here for you. Talk moves are essentially sentence starters that students can use to get themselves into the conversation, and to draw other people into the conversation.

Student: …by the government and they just can’t like figure out what to do… Catherine Paul: I taped the talk moves right on the table, so that they would be ever present in everyone’s mind. — Today, I want you to keep track of your talk moves.– Every time they used a talk move, they’d put a check on their sticky note. So if somebody at your table looks like they don’t have a talk move check mark yet, invite them into the conversation. How could you do that?

Philip: Say, like, “What do you think?” Catherine Paul: Definitely. Would you use their name?

Philip: Yeah.

Catherine Paul: Awesome.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: Everything about activating a child’s cognitive skills begins with activating their social connectedness. Verbalizing and using language, and working with peers creates that kind of social stimulus that drives the development of the brain.

Philip: I pretty much look at the thing every single time, to see if there’s something I can say, like a clarifying question. — Can you explain more about, like why you would get in trouble?

Salma: He spray painted something on his rival soccer team’s school. — When you ask a person a clarifying question, it’s either, “Oh, I heard you said,” or, “Can you repeat what you said?” or “To add onto.” Catherine Paul: They help enormously with language learners. They give everybody a platform to jump into a conversation, because half the sentence is there for them already. But they also challenge other types of learners who may be accustomed to doing independent work, and they need a bridge to collaborate more with a group. It pushes kids out of their comfort zone of social conversations, and it moves them more towards a professional and an academic kind of register.

Student: All his accomplishments in his past, like all the other marches he had, like Martin Luther King and other previous marches and he wants to … Student: I heard you say previous marches. Like, does it say it say anything about what he was involved with?

Student: Yeah, like he was in Martin Luther King marches.

Catherine Paul: I do talk moves because, in order to have a great discussion, everyone has to feel like they’re a part of it, and valued. And when they walk away, they really have bridged a gap with someone that maybe they wouldn’t necessarily talked to, or talked to on that level.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: This teacher is aware of children having different levels of comfort and discomfort, of making their skills visible, and she’s getting kids to support each other’s participation with these talk moves. This teacher created a pathway for every single child in this class to belong.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, when pictures, words, and numbers combine in the form of a well-written children’s book, the result can have tremendous value in the math classroom. In 2023, researchers compiled insights from 16 recent classroom studies and found that integrating picture books into math lessons can benefit learners in a variety of ways.

In pre-K all the way through middle school, picture books were seen to boost student engagement; likewise, these books can improve performance on tasks ranging from counting to 20 to calculating diameters.

## Transcript

Narrator : The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words could be expressed as a simple multiplication formula. But can reading math picture books really multiply mathematical learning? A 2023 research review confirmed that math picture books improved student engagement and attitudes towards mathematics. These books helped students understand mathematical representations, like graphs or physical models. Likewise, they boosted performance on tasks as diverse as counting to 20, understanding place value, and calculating diameters. Math picture books work wonders in early childhood, where students often try to guess what will happen next, leading to heightened interest in the problems and in finding solutions. Yet even middle school students seem mesmerized by math read-alouds. In one study, sixth graders called it their favorite part of the lesson. Importantly, math picture books are not a substitute for procedural fluency or mathematical practice. Typically, the researchers noted, teachers used picture books to bracket their math units, using them to introduce an upcoming concept or to recap what was just learned. To harness the power of math books in your classroom, consider options like Dozens of Donuts , How Much Is a Million? , Circle Dogs , Great Estimations , and Uma Wimple Charts Her House .

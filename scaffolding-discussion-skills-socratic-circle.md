## Transcript

Alison Beattie: I can discuss whether or not confederate monuments should be removed by listening to my peers, and using evidence. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: By talking and expressing oneself, we learn more deeply. One thing we know from the science of learning is that complex instruction needs to be scaffolded, that students need to be enabled to take each step along the path. And in this classroom, we see a very sophisticated conversation being scaffolded to help them learn how to talk to each other about this very difficult concept in a very respectful and thoughtful way.

Alison Beattie: We’ve just finished a six week unit on the Civil War. They needed a safe space to talk about racial issues and justice issues. I decided a discussion would be the best way for them to learn about the issue, bring in evidence, and have their voices be heard. I sourced about fifteen different articles to meet kids where they were at, in terms of length of texts or level of complexity of texts. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: Part of the scaffolding in this classroom is that this teacher has found fifteen different texts for students to read, to prepare for the discussion, so that they can speak with evidence, and so that their evidence is accessible to them.

Alison Beattie: What’s important to understand, that even though somebody says something you might disagree with, everybody’s contributing to this shared dialog in this safe space. Somebody start us off.

Student: I think confederate monuments should be removed, based on the Atlantic. It said, “Establishing monuments to confederate war heroes in turn celebrates men who committed treason.” Alison Beattie: I was very pleased with a lot of students who really came out of their shell.

Student: I want to disagree with a lot of you, saying that they’re bad.

Alison Beattie: I loved that there was healthy debate.

Student: I don’t know about the rest of you, but I don’t them in this country.

Student: We need to find a way for each side to be able to see the opposing side’s points, instead of just argue them.

Alison Beattie: They were polite, they were encouraging, and I think it helps them understand that deeper understanding of history.

Student: It’s all in perspective. If you know it’s wrong, then you can use it to create change.

Alison Beattie: So we’re actually going to stop there. There were a couple people in the room tracking things from the conversation. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: She’s thought about the fact that some students may be more comfortable participating by tracking the conversation, and then reporting out what they’ve found.

Student: Athen used evidence in a cool way. He brought up how– Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: So there are many ways for students to get their brains engaged and to be participating in this discussion. The deep conversation they’ve just had is actually extended by the fact that they get to reflect at the end, in writing.

Alison Beattie: Tell me how your thinking is now changed after this conversation. It’s okay if it didn’t change, but you need to tell me why. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: That reflection, which his metacognitive, really helps the students carry more learning out of the experience they’ve just had.

## Article

What happens when kindergartners spend almost their entire school day outside, even through a harsh Canadian winter? When two teachers from Pierre Elliott Trudeau Elementary School (PETES), in Gatineau, Quebec, dubbed a tiny park near their urban schoolyard “the magical forest” and started taking their small charges there daily, the learning adventures began. They say this approach has resulted in fewer distractions, better inclusion for all students, and more effective learning.

## Transcript

Teah Sarrazin: My students get to move in ways that they could never move in a classroom. They get to see things in person that they would never see inside a classroom. They get to experience nature. There’s space to be 5 and 6 years old. Heather Balson-Riosa: We spend most of our day outside with the children. We cover all of our curriculum that we need to cover in kindergarten, but we do it all in our outdoor classroom. Heather Balson-Riosa: Can you draw me a 1 in the air? Draw me a 1. Heather Balson-Riosa: We start the day at about 7:45, and we greet the children outside. We get ready for our day, make sure everyone’s dressed properly. Then we go out for morning circle.

Classmates: It’s so nice that we’re together. Heather Balson-Riosa: We’re outside every day, all day, rain, snow. Canadian winters are quite chilly. Heather Balson-Riosa: It’s not raining, pouring cats and dogs, like it was yesterday, right?

Child: It’s again snowing.

Teah Sarrazin: If a child comes that is not dressed, you know, for the weather, we have collected many things over the years and we do supply the appropriate clothing.

Teah Sarrazin: We start in the schoolyard for the most of the day, but for the middle chunk for about an hour and a half, we spend that time in the magical forest. Our schoolyard is beautiful. We have a lot of green space, but it is very clear what its purpose is with a play structure and a soccer field. And we were looking for something more open-ended. About a five-minute walk from here we had this little public space, so it was open to us. We divided into our three groups, and that’s when we do our math activity, our language arts activity in either French or English, and a nature movement-based activity.

Teah Sarrazin: Trois mots, three big science words. Are you ready?

Child: Yeah.

Teah Sarrazin: Migration. Have you heard that one?

Child: Oh, yes.

Teah Sarrazin: Oh, yes.

Teah Sarrazin: Today we were looking at what animals do in the winter, so we talked a bit about the animals that gather food versus ones that migrate. Animals that stay here and rest, so hibernating.

Teah Sarrazin: All winter long.

Teah Sarrazin: The forest really lends itself really well for we call it UDL, which is a Universal Design for Learning. When we do it inside classrooms, it’s different seating, for example. You might have little wobble seats. And the forest just gives us that. So for the children who need to wiggle a little more, they’ll choose a seat where they can do that. For the ones that want to maybe flop a little bit on the ground, they might choose a lower rock.

Teah Sarrazin: Migrates. Go find a warm place. Bye, mes amis.

Teah Sarrazin: There’s no expectation to sit in a certain way, to be still when they’re not really ready to be still. There’s no expectation to be completely silent.

Teah Sarrazin: But white foam will grow back, and it’s called — Child: What? That’s so cool!

Teah Sarrazin: What is it called when something changes colors?

Teah Sarrazin: The nature, just the breeze on their face and the movement around them, the crackling of the leaves, gives them that little bit to be able to actually focus better. It’s a healthier learning environment, in my opinion. We always say, “Find your forest.” It doesn’t have to be a forest; it can be a little park close by. It can be in your schoolyard, and you can bring things in. We like to bring in big branches that aren’t just here naturally. We have a bale of hay out there right now, rocks and leaves and all those things to build with. It’s a little work, but it’s not impossible, and it is so worth it.

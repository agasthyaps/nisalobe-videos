## Transcript

Narrator: According to a 2016 study, elementary students are distracted 26 percent of the time in class. That’s more than an hour lost every school day. Predictably, a lot of things can draw them off task. Other students, playing with school supplies, posters and decorations, daydreams or fidgeting, and lots of other stuff, too. But you can do something about it. Keep your lessons short.

Teacher: Let’s get our reading glasses.

Narrator: The sweet spot is about ten to fifteen minutes for young children according to research.

Teacher: Part is activating.

Narrator: Much longer, and they’ll lose focus. And staying focused means taking breaks. Integrate opportunities to move about, listen to music, or engage in storytelling to recharge student attention. You can minimize visual distractions, because visually complex classroom walls can reduce academic performance. And be sparing, keep 20 to 50 percent of your walls clear and prioritize student work, instructional supports, and inspiring role models. And try to switch it up a little. Mix direct instruction with small-group discussions and self-directed work for better engagement. Finally, consider adjusting your seating arrangements. It’s simple, but impactful: spreading out talkative students can decrease classroom disruptions by 66 percent.

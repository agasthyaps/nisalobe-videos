## Article

Classrooms are full of distractions, and at times, it can be tricky to tell if students are actually thinking about and processing the content a teacher is presenting. There is a lot to cover in a limited time, and sometimes the need to move forward prevails, without any assurance that each student has grasped the concept. Enter individual whiteboards: a tool that can help make certain everyone in the class is paying attention to the lesson.

In Evie Beall-Cottrell’s eighth-grade history class at Monocacy Middle School in Frederick, Maryland, every student has their own mini-whiteboard, and they’re at the ready to make their thinking visible on their boards when she asks a question. Not only does this ensure that every student is participating, but it helps them take more ownership of their ideas. “Giving time, like 60–90 seconds, so everyone can think—everyone can put down their answer, knowing that they need to have a reason to support their answer—gives everybody a voice,” Beall-Cottrell explains.

“And also making it low-stakes, it doesn’t leave anyone in the dust.” To deepen understanding further, Beall-Cottrell asks follow-up questions as a means to get students to explain their thinking. Anticipating that they may be called on to expand on their answer prompts students to be ready to share and can lead to lively class discussions. Learning Science Partners cofounder Jim Heal appreciates the accountability that this practice can bring to the learning.

“As a teacher, you are saying, ‘What you’re thinking and writing is something that you are then going to make public within the room. We’re here to show what we know—and that’s part of the way that we hold ourselves accountable for our thoughts.’” For more ways to use individual whiteboards in the classroom for participation, read Nicole Greene’s article for Edutopia, “ 6 Ways to Use Clipboards and Whiteboards to Boost Engagement .” This video is part of our How Learning Happens series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Evie Beall-Cottrell: We are going to look at four of the industrialists… Jim Heal: Students cannot learn something unless they pay meaningful attention to it. Evie Beall-Cottrell: Some of the things that they’ve done, some of the positive and some of the negative.

Jim Heal: The use of mini-whiteboards are a really effective way to get all students thinking. So if you compare a mini-whiteboard strategy to instead something like show me a thumbs-up if you agree, a mini-whiteboard forces students to think about the idea. And I don’t mean that in a negative sense. You need to be able to make it so that a student cannot think about anything other than what you’re asking them to think about. Evie Beall-Cottrell: And you’re going to decide, are they a captain of industry or are they a robber baron? Evie Beall-Cottrell: Students came in, they got their whiteboards, dry erase markers, and erasers. I went over the objective, went over what we were going to accomplish during class. Evie Beall-Cottrell: If you decide that they’re a little captain of industry and a little robber baron, you’ve got to give me some percentages. Evie Beall-Cottrell: And then we got into talking about the industrialists. Evie Beall-Cottrell: So Andrew Carnegie, a little background on him. He gained most of his wealth through investments in the railroad and telegraph. Evie Beall-Cottrell: And then they were able to put in where they thought that these men would fall. And then that was where we used the whiteboards as a space where they could answer. Evie Beall-Cottrell: If it’s one or the other, you can just write RB or CI, but if you think it’s split, maybe he’s a little bit of both. Give me a percentage. Evie Beall-Cottrell: Giving time like the 60 to 90s so everyone can think. Everyone can put down their answer knowing that they needed to have a reason to support their answer. All right. Boards up in three, two, and one. Evie Beall-Cottrell: I think giving everybody a voice, giving everybody space and also making it low-stakes, it doesn’t leave anyone in the dust.

Student: It seems like he didn’t treat his workers right, but he also invested a lot and did charity. Evie Beall-Cottrell: And that gives our students that are ready to have these higher-level discussions space to do so.

Student: He also stated that he wasn’t making railroads for the gain of the public, it was for his own gain of money. Evie Beall-Cottrell: But it also allows the students that may be taking more time to get there, or maybe having trouble grasping a concept that still allows them to effectively participate, not just check out what other people do the work. Lots of captain of industries.

Jim Heal: It also holds with it a level of accountability because you’re saying what you’re thinking and writing is something that you are then going to make public within the room. We’re here to show what we know, and that’s part of the way that we hold ourselves accountable for our thoughts. Evie Beall-Cottrell: Fantastic. All right, guys, put your stuff away and have a great day.

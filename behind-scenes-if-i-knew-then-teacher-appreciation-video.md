## Transcript

Behind the Scenes of “If I Knew Then” (Teacher Appreciation Video) Man: So the objective for us today is to actually make a video that celebrates all of you guys.

Man: So thank you so much for agreeing to be a part of it. If you haven’t, you should, because it’ll make you feel really good.

Woman: I used to think that maybe what I was doing didn’t matter or wasn’t working, and now that I’ve had a few more years under my belt, it feels good to be reminded of my conviction and to remember that what I’m doing matters.

Man: I can’t imagine doing any other job, because this is so different every day. I was young when I started it, and I’m not now, but I feel younger than when I started, because being around kids all day and being infected by their enthusiasm about learning and their curiosity, it reminds me of how much fun it is to be a constant learner and keep learning. So I learned from them that– how fun it is to be curious, not to get bored with stuff and to continue to make things engaging and exciting and kind of look at studying and learning and life that way.

Man: This is scene five, take one, mark.

Man: Dear first year self, the impact of your work is beyond what you can currently imagine.

Man: When the going gets tough, remember why you do the things that you do. Remember that every child has immeasurable value. Oh my gosh.

Woman: You’re about to embark on a journey that is going to define you in the best of ways.

Woman: Enjoy your teaching, best Spanish teach ever, Erica Magana.

## Article

Regularly making space for students to interact with their natural surroundings through nature journaling—sketching, annotating, and slowing down to observe the seemingly ordinary bits of nature close by—can have benefits for a student’s social and emotional well-being as well as their scientific comprehension. Today, young students most commonly learn about the parts and processes of the natural world by rote, memorizing concepts from a textbook, which does little to inspire wonder and curiosity. But encouraging students to go outdoors and take notice of the tiniest flowers in the grass and other bits of nature that usually go overlooked, on the other hand, soothes stress and sparks interest while still engaging them in rigorous, purposeful academic work.

Sketching and writing reflections about natural phenomena also builds crucial cognitive and processing skills like close observation, technical illustration, attention to detail, critical thinking, and the ability to organize and categorize information. When drawing and writing in a journal, students process information in multiple ways, leading to deeper comprehension and more durable memories.

## Transcript

Narrator: In 1831, a young Charles Darwin embarked on a five-year voyage, exploring the coasts of South America, armed with his notebook and pencil. What he discovered through sketches of over 300 species of plants and wildlife paved the way for a breakthrough in identifying species diversity. A scientist in training today, by contrast, would mostly learn about photosynthesis by rote and rarely touch actual flowers in the process. Studying the shape and function of a stamen, a petal, or a pistil through a textbook, removed from being in nature, does little to ignite a sense of wonder and curiosity. Encouraging students to wander with notebooks and pencils, paying attention to the tiniest flowers in the grass and other bits of nature that usually go overlooked, on the other hand, can slow them down and ease stress, but still engage them in rigorous and purposeful academic work. When sketching and annotating in a journal, students process information in multiple ways, leading to deeper comprehension and more durable memories when compared to writing alone. Additionally, researchers have long observed that learning in natural settings improves social and emotional well-being, curiosity, and engagement. You don’t have to be a wildlife expert to lead a successful nature journaling expedition. Nearby trees, rocks, and bushes are teeming with life, and kids will be quick to notice, marveling at the smallest encounters, like spotting a frog, running alongside a butterfly, or discovering a beetle under a log. Taking students outdoors and encouraging them to pay close attention, sketch, and take note of even the seemingly ordinary organisms around them can spark excitement and build foundational curiosity in all grade levels.

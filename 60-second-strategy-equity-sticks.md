## Transcript

Student: I want to read mine.

Teacher: I’m going to pick another one. Bryce.

Student: Yep.

Teacher: All right. We always have those kids whose voices are not always heard. Sometimes it’s a good idea must to pull a stick and say, “Do you want to share?” Can you show me your picture? Excellent. Let’s give her one big clap. So simple. You can just get popsicle sticks and you write their name on them. Oh, thank you. So I’ll draw the first one, and then we’ll have the next person draw the next one. Noah, do you want to share what you have? And then they can choose the next person out. Remember, no peeking. Choose a friend. I always give them the right to pass.

Student: Blue.

Teacher: Unless they pass all the time.

Student: Pass.

Teacher: And then I’ll say, “Oh, why don’t you just try?” I just believe that equity sticks are fair. It’s a small thing, but I do think it helps. All right, so the rest of you, I’ll leave you in the bucket and you guys will get to read after lunch.

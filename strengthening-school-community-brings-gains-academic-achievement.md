## Transcript

Strengthening School Community Brings Gains in Academic Achievement (Transcript) Natalie Walchuk: I think the number one thing that has been most effective here has been really focusing on relationships, knowing the story of each member of my community and that has been one of the most impactful parts of the work and also enabled me to do large chunks of change with a receptive group of people behind me, because we already had kind of a foundational relationship happening, and then, secondly, really seeing the children are this wonderful, messy mush of needs that range from academic to emotional to physical, and so how do we meet all those on our campus? We have three key things that support student outcomes. Dialogue Circles are a great way for students and teachers to get to know each other and learn how to communicate about hard things in a safe place. It’s an essential practice of Restorative Justice and a great place to get started.

Student: I think you should just walk away and if they still bully you, then you should tell the teacher.

Natalie Walchuk: Every teacher, every day, uses Circle to check in with students to see how they’re doing and uses mindfulness to prepare them for learning.

Allison Kenny: Would that work?

Natalie Walchuk: We have art partnerships with community organizations that come in and use art as a way to support critical thinking and communication skill development.

Allison Kenny: And the only one we’re really in charge of is ourselves.

Natalie Walchuk: Every student gets two art classes per week as part of their core day. And then we offer a range of classes outside of the school day for kids to participate here on campus. Many students who maybe are not as traditionally successful in the classroom that’s the reason why they want to come to school and a reason why they want to engage in academic work, because they’re having another part of themselves satisfied.

Jahi: And all you have are two index cards and some Sharpies. What would you create?

Natalie Walchuk: We’ve worked very hard to create a community where teachers want to step outside their classrooms, talk and work together and really ask the hard questions. One thing I found when I came to Glenview was the staff had a hard time questioning practice or being a critical friend and kind of probing on questions. So we’ve worked to develop a culture where you have to have ask a constructive question and that has allowed us to go deeper, faster during our PD time.

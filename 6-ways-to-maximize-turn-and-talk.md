Though turn and talk is a go-to peer-to-peer reflection activity in many classrooms for a reason, teachers can face some common setbacks when they implement it. It’s easy for conversations to get off-topic or stall. Students can get stuck in ruts of pairing with the same people, or they can get left out altogether.

But engaging with classmates to discuss class topics is an important practice for students, and a few simple structures that teachers can put in place will help everyone get the most out of turn and talk. To give students a way to partner up with peers they do not usually work with, teachers can introduce a simple and fun pairing system. Splitting the class into two equal groups—such as lions and tigers, stripes and polka dots, or bread and butter—and having each student match up with someone from the opposite group and then rotate provides a way to diversify who students chat with.

And when teachers clearly explain who will speak first and who will listen first, students can jump right in with clarity and confidence. If the room is feeling quiet or shy, teachers can try kicking off the activity with a warm-up question like: Summer or winter? Cats or dogs?

Mountains or beaches? After 30 seconds of responses, the class may feel more comfortable diving into the subject matter. Often, as students discuss, they can get off-topic or stall out.

If there are sentence starters written somewhere where all can reference them, it’s easier for conversations to find their way back to addressing the content at hand. Sometimes, the best way for teachers to get students to loosen up in conversations is by having them get up and move around the room, pairing with someone to walk and talk with. Lastly, in cases where a student is left without a partner, teachers can celebrate the group who includes them, creating a culture of inclusion within their classrooms.

There are lots of ways to make turn and talk as inclusive as possible . With the right scaffolding and a bit of intention, turn and talk can be a space where all perspectives are listened to.

## Transcript

Narrator: Turn and Talk is a classroom staple that can increase participation, allow students to share ideas and deepen understanding, but sometimes things don’t go as planned. Students feel left out, conversations stall, or topics get off track. So how can you make Turn and Talk work for everyone? Here are six easy ways to elevate this classic activity. Setting up clear pairing systems can help vary who students work with and encourage new connections. When you want to switch it up from seat partners, split the class into two equal groups, lions and tigers, stripes and polka dots, bread and butter, anything that feels fun. Pair each student with someone from the other group. After a short stint, rotate. This is a good way to ensure that students speak with a variety of classmates. Assigning roles in each pair can provide clarity on who talks and who listens first. Explain that in each pair, there will be a listener and a speaker. Let them know which role each student will hold. After one minute, have students switch. This encourages all students to practice listening skills as well as speaking, and create system that encourages all voices to be heard. Easing in with a fun icebreaker can be low risk and high connection. Have students start their Turn and Talk with a quick either or question. Summer or winter? Cats or dogs? Mountains or beach? Allot 30 seconds for pairs to answer and explain why. This allows everyone to then move into the academic content feeling more relaxed and comfortable with each other. Many times conversations tend to drift or stall, and students need an on-ramp back to the topic. Try sentence starters like, “I liked how you …” Or, “I’d like to hear more about …” Post a few on the wall so students always have a way to re-enter the discussion if it gets off track. When students are able to move their bodies, it helps them release some energy, reduces their stress, and gets them ready to engage with each other. Get students up and out of their seats by letting them mill around the classroom to find a buddy to chat with about a designated topic. You can also let students connect during transition times. This gives them more opportunities to Turn and Talk while maximizing learning time. When students pair up, no one should be left out. If a student doesn’t have a partner, be sure to celebrate the group that invites that person in. If there are no volunteers, pick a pair who will be lucky enough to get an extra thinker. They can become a trio. Practicing and praising inclusion helps it become a part of your classroom culture. When presented intentionally, Turn and Talk isn’t just a time filler. It can be a space for students to connect with peers, practice communication skills, and feel empowered to share their thoughts with a variety of classmates.

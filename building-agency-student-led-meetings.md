## Article

At Casco Bay High School in Portland, Maine—an EL Education school—student voice isn’t just encouraged, it’s embedded in the fabric of the school’s culture. The school has multiple structures in place to help students feel engaged in the school community, but one of the key ways they bring this to life is through their student-led all-school meetings. Every Wednesday, small groups of students take turns leading the gathering—setting the agenda, sharing important announcements, showcasing student work, and ensuring that their voices set the tone—and shape the school community.

Each advisory group has multiple opportunities throughout the year to organize and run a meeting. In addition to being thoughtful about the content of the meeting, students handle the logistics. They plan carefully who is going to speak to specific topics and even have to set up and take down the chairs.

The result? A space where students feel heard, gain confidence, and take ownership of their school experience. According to 12th-grade student Mardia, “School meeting is a time for people to share their work and gain confidence from it—because people are watching what you do.” Casco Bay High School’s approach exemplifies how teachers and school leaders can actively empower students and cultivate a sense of responsibility.

By giving students real opportunities to lead, they’re not just preparing them for the future—they’re demonstrating that their voices have impact now. As former Principal Derek Pierce explains, “The more we give kids the microphone, the more we trust and respect that their voice matters, the more they will bring respectful and trusted voices to our community.” Find more ideas for implementing different types of student-led meetings from Alexandra Auriemma’s article for Edutopia, “ How School Leaders Can Support Student Voice and Agency .” To see more videos about this school, visit the Casco Bay High School page on Edutopia.

## Transcript

Student: OK, we have a lot of information about prom. You can purchase tickets at lunch and ACAD by the front door of the main office.

Derek Pierce: The goal at Casco Bay is to figure out every way we possibly can for kids to understand their voice matters. We have a weekly school meeting that is run by students and that gives students an opportunity to come up and share their quality work, to be goofy and silly, to be celebrated, and every advisory group has an opportunity to host that school meeting over the course of the year.

Mardia: The Character Pathway for working collaboratively goes to Khalil Summers. The people who host school meeting changes every week. They introduce themselves, they pick out what they want to do, and then it goes to announcements.

Student: Saturday is Arts and Music Fest from 10:00 to 3:00.

Mardia: School meeting’s like time for people to share their work and gain that confidence from it, because people are watching what you do.

Student: My topic is mental health, and I believe that our mental health is bigger than ourselves.

Student: Depression, or mental health, or anxiety, it’s just like any other injury almost.

Mardia: I feel like that’s one of the major ways that the school shows that they’re listening to us and things that we want to change.

Student: We’re going to give you guys a bit of context and explanation for what we’re going to be talking about tomorrow in our courageous conversation. So, some key terms. So, we have casual and interpersonal misogyny.

Student: And a third of the male students, 34 percent, say they have witnessed someone using sexist language at school.

Derek Pierce: It’s super-important that we give kids the microphone.

Student: …slide show for what we’re going to be talking about tomorrow in our courageous conversation.

Derek Pierce: The more we trust and respect that their voice matters, the more they will bring a respectful and trusted voice to our community.

Student: Thank you.

Derek Pierce: Give it up for everybody who presented today, shared their expertise, shared their wisdom, shared their knowledge.

Each student’s journey through the school year is not without its hurdles and setbacks. So it’s important that students be regularly reminded of their successes, no matter how minor. Recognition and goal-setting are at the heart of several simple practices that teachers can use to boost student motivation—and keep their classes engaged and inspired from the first day of school until the first day of summer break.

Cathleen Beachboard , an English language arts teacher in Virginia, starts a “Caught You Being Awesome” board at the beginning of each school year. Whenever a student displays an act of “awesomeness,” whether that’s a high score on an assignment or something as minor as sharing their snack with a classmate, she snaps a Polaroid photo of them in their moment of glory and pins it to the board. Laura Driscoll , a curriculum developer from New York, suggests celebrating small wins with paper success chains.

She asks students to write a short description of their win on a strip of paper that they then tape into a loop, which serves as the first link of their chain. As the wins accumulate, the chain grows new links. By the end of the year, students are able to see how long their chain of successes has grown.

In South Texas, music teacher Mirelle Castañeda asks each student to create a two-sided goal card on the first day of class. On one side, she asks them to write a goal for the group, which will be displayed on the class bulletin board for all to see. On the reverse side of the index card, each student then writes an individual goal that they’ll work on in private throughout the year.

The combined goals encourage the class to focus on individual progress—while also keeping in mind the advancement of their entire group. For more strategies to help boost student motivation, check out Paige Tutt’s article “ 13 Ways to Celebrate Students’ Small Wins and Build Motivation. ”

## Transcript

Narrator: Looking for ways to keep students engaged throughout the school year? Here are three simple but effective practices that will celebrate your students’ small wins and sustain their motivation all year long. Cathleen Beachboard teaches high school ELA in Virginia. She starts a Caught You Being Awesome board right at the beginning of the year.

Cathleen Beachboard: When someone in the classroom does something really well or helps someone else or is struggling and they finally get it, I want to celebrate with them right then and there. It shows that I value what they’re doing and I value them, and also it allows me to give them that boost of recognition that they deserve. And so I take a little Polaroid that develops instantly of the person. Or, if they don’t want their photo taken, we write down what happened and I take the work that they did and we put it up on the wall. And that way, they get that moment of celebration and when kids come in throughout the day, they look at it and it motivates them to want to be awesome, too.

Narrator: Laura Driscoll is a New York-based SEL and development specialist. She suggests having students co-create paper success chains that grow as the months go by.

Laura Driscoll: Throughout the year, students write down their small achievements on just colorful paper strips, and they add them to a growing chain that you can hang around your classroom. We’re talking small stuff here. When kids see the chain getting longer, they have literal proof that they’re capable. Kids can share these wins with the class. Everyone’s celebrating together. They choose how they recognize their own progress, and this kind of builds some ownership over their learning, of what they’re working on and what they’re proud of. And motivation is really fed by those feelings of competence, belonging, and autonomy. And so building routines that reinforce these feelings can be incredibly powerful. And honestly, the beauty is how simple it is. It’s just paper strips and the intention to notice the small moments that lead to big growth.

Narrator: Mirelle Castañeda is a music teacher from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. She uses goal cards to keep her learners motivated. Mirelle Castañeda: So when the year starts and the students walk into the classroom, they are given an index card. And on one side of the index card, they’re asked to write a goal for the group. And on the other side, they’re asked to write an individual goal that will remain private. I ask them to reflect on where they’ve been and where they want to go. The individual goal does not face the classroom. It’s on the other side of the card, on the bulletin board, because that’s a very private goal. And then I just provide different markers and pencils because some kids really get into it and they’ll decorate them. And the more they decorate it, the more they kind of want to share it with the class. It’s important because once they leave our classroom, they’re not leaving as a group, they’re leaving as a person. So it’s important to teach them how to set goals for themselves and how to achieve them so that they can continue to grow in life beyond the classroom.

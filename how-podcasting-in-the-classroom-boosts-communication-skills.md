Podcasting can provide students with a platform to further develop their oral communication skills, collaborate creatively with their peers, improve their digital literacy, and become stronger storytellers and critical thinkers. At Beaumonde Heights Junior Middle School , teachers Chey Cheney and Pawan “Pav” Wander have made podcasting an essential tool to support and amplify student voices and nurture their multicultural school community. Cheney and Wander developed an eight-step cheat sheet for teaching podcasting in the classroom based on their years of experience working on podcasts with students.

When introducing the unit, keeping things simple and starting with purpose is key. Teachers can facilitate a conversation on why podcasting is a useful tool—to share learnings across subject matters, tell stories, or interview experts. Discussing the value of podcasting with students helps them understand what skills they are honing through the process, including writing, literacy, oral communication, and creative collaboration.

Selecting a podcast style is an essential next step. Options include interviews, conversational discussions, solo reflections, narrative fiction, or research-based informative formats. Having several style options gives students the agency to explore a variety of storytelling methods.

It’s helpful to share examples in class, whether popular professional podcasts or previously produced student work. Planning the episode is a critical step that supports students to refine their structure and storytelling skills. One simple and effective podcasting format that helps keep the recordings organized is to start with an introduction, move to the main content, and end with a wrap-up.

Students can brainstorm topics, prepare questions, or conduct research to flesh out the three main areas of their story arc. Short episodes of five to 15 minutes are ideal for beginners. When students are ready to record, finding a quiet space is critical.

This can be an empty classroom, corner of the library, or office. Simple gear works well for recording—laptops, tablets, or phones with microphones. If teachers have more space and budget available to them, creating a recording studio with the students is an exciting opportunity to design a creative environment where they will be able to practice their skills.

Cheney and Wander were able to use their school’s technology funds to set up a small studio in an unused room on their campus. Recording tools like GarageBand and Soundtrap are free and accessible for classrooms. Students should take turns, speak clearly, and rerecord short sections as needed, as opposed to rerecording entire segments.

Editing focuses on trimming mistakes, balancing sound, and adding simple intros or outros as well as royalty-free music or sound effects. Tools like Audacity and WeVideo make editing manageable. Sharing the finished podcasts is where the magic happens.

Students can create cover art for their podcasts using Canva . Podcasts can stay within the school community and be published on Google Classroom, shared during assemblies or school events, or posted on the school website or newsletter before expanding to broader audiences like social media, if appropriate. Students can also share their work with their families and communities and enjoy celebrating their progress and growth.

Podcasting in the classroom isn’t about perfection or professional equipment—it’s more about growth, creativity, and connection. For teachers looking for a way to empower students and make learning more authentic, podcasting is a great place to start.

## Transcript

Student: You guys hear it?

Student: Hello? You guys hear me?

Student: Go ahead. We’re good. OK, ready?

Student: Whether you are a student or an adult, I’m sure we’re always excited for trips. Pawan “Pav” Wander: Our students come from so many different cultures where oral storytelling and oral communication is the primary means of knowledge transmission from one generation to another. So we want to be able to reflect that in our teaching and our learning as much as possible. So podcasting really allows us to do that. Beaumonde Heights is a very diverse school. It’s generally a hub for new immigrants. So we love to provide many opportunities for students to really explore and amplify their identities in the school community.

Pav Wander: Morning. Morning. Good morning.

Pav Wander: OK, we’re gonna get started with our podcasting lesson today.

Pav Wander: So when we began podcasting, we started by talking about different styles of podcasts.

Pav Wander: What are some styles of podcasts that you could produce?

Student: There’s solo podcasts.

Pav Wander: Excellent. So maybe something that they know a lot about.

Pav Wander: We listen to a lot of podcasts. We explored podcast sites.

Pav Wander: I’m gonna play an audio clip of a previously produced student podcast. Recorded VO: Officials in Canada are concerned about the recent spike in hospital admissions around the nation.

Pav Wander: What stood out to you? Anything?

Student: In the beginning, how, like, the helicopter sound effect where, like, it was, like, quieting down so you can hear, like, the person actually speaking. So it sounded, like, really realistic.

Pav Wander: Awesome.

Pav Wander: And then begins our planning process. We create an outline for their podcast and then really hash out what that podcast is going to look like.

Student: And after that will be like a flashback.

Student: Yeah. Yeah.

Student: It’ll go back in time and then from when they were passing… Pav Wander: So we tried to get students to really think about how their podcast would mimic a real podcast that they would hear on a podcasting site. So the planning part is extremely crucial to recording a well-constructed and well-produced podcast.

Pav Wander: Roya, your group will be downstairs in the podcast studio, and you’ll start your recording down there.

Pav Wander: The next process is recording. So we actually get into the studio, and we sit down with our group members and we start recording. So, for the narrative podcasts, students walk into the recording studio with their scripts completely ready and done. Students know who is playing which character, and they read their scripts, and they do all of their recording.

Student: Well, both of you are wrong. I barely even talk.

Student: First of all, who’s both of you? Second of all, didn’t I just tell you guys not to fight? It’s not that hard.

Prabhleen: Podcasting has helped me speak more confidently and with more clarity. I’ve learned how to project my voice and use different tones when I need to.

Prabhleen: Always having a dispute.

Pav Wander: If it’s going to be a little bit more conversational or an interview style, podcast students have some rough ideas of what they want to say, but to maintain the authenticity of their conversation, it’s far less scripted. After we’re done with recording, we now move into post production. So students will upload all of their recorded audio, and this is the opportunity for them to take out pieces that they didn’t like, perhaps add in some music.

Pav Wander: So you want to really be mindful about which sound effects and what music you are using. So make sure that what you are using really adds to the story rather than distracts from it.

Pav Wander: There’s so much more to podcasting than just sitting down at a microphone and speaking. There’s a lot of creativity.

Sukhwinder Singh Buall: It involves reading, it involves writing, and obviously communicating orally, so they have the skills that they need to thrive in the real world.

Pav Wander: I want to be able to take my students from a culture of consumption to a culture of creation, and that doesn’t happen in a vacuum. We have to really structure that learning for students so that they can see what that looks like. So providing students with the tools and the pieces that they need to make that content creation happen is really important in a language classroom, and podcasting has really allowed us to do that.

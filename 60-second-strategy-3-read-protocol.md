The 3-read protocol and math tasks that CVES uses were developed by Exemplars , a company that provides a library of rich performance tasks and professional development for K-12 schools.

## Transcript

Teacher: So today we’re going to continue with our three-read protocol. Why do we do our three-read protocol? The three-read protocol helps them have a better understanding of what the math problem means. I’ll read, they read, we read together. JC and Emma are playing a game on their computer. Initially I read the problem without any numbers and there’s no questions. When kids see numbers, they start to get very confused right away. So if we take out those numbers for a moment, they’re reading it as a story.

Student: The gist of the story was, each round, they get a certain amount of points.

Teacher: and then they read, but this time, they have the numbers.

Students: JC has seventy-four thousand.

Teacher: They’re going to pull out any important words, any numbers. Then we go back. We reread the problem a third time with questions.

Students: Who earned the most points altogether?

Teacher: The three-read protocol solidifies in their head what they’re reading and it helps to build their fluency.

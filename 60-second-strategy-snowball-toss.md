## Transcript

Teacher: All right, gentlemen, what have we learned about stress from the week’s discussion?

Student: Today we did an activity in my classroom where we talked about stress.

Teacher: We’re going to do the snowball activity, okay? I’m trying to get them to know how to identify stress and then know how to be able to adapt and cope and work with that. Okay, go ahead and take one minute to finish up. After they wrote down their stress, they balled up the paper. I asked them, “What should you do with stress?” and they said, “Get rid of it.” “So let’s get rid of the stress,” and we had a snowball fight.

Student: Everybody ready?

Students: Yeah.

Student: Go.

Teacher: The idea is that we’re moving around, we’re able to have fun, laugh, scream, be loud, and then have that discussion about stress. Everybody get a snowball. Afterwards, they unwrap the snowball and they read what their peer was stressed about. Who’d like to begin?

Student: I learned that stress can cause many things, like depression.

Teacher: They got up, it was interactive and it was hands on. They were able to have a conversation with each other about things that they were dealing with.

Student: I haven’t felt good about myself in such a long time.

Teacher: Which is promoting interpersonal skills and learning during the process.

## Article

At P.S. 249, the Caton School, in Brooklyn, New York, kindergarten teacher Julie Jay starts nearly every lesson by stating exactly what she wants her students to learn. She closes by circling back and having the kids share what they just learned—and how they know they’ve got it. This brings clarity to her classroom, she says, and makes it clear how every part of the lesson relates back to her objectives.

On top of that, the built-in reflection helps the learning stick.

## Transcript

Julie Jay: Today, I want to teach you how to make your writing easy to read.

Julie Jay: Framing of the lesson is really a clarity strategy: clarity for the teacher and clarity for the students. You’re creating a frame around the lesson to hold all of the content. At the beginning of the lesson, you’re telling the children explicitly what you’re going to be teaching them. So that writers make their writing easy to read.

Julie Jay: By putting spaces between their words. Using lowercase letters. Putting a capital letter at the beginning of the sentence and putting a period at the end.

Julie Jay: Then they go and they do their work.

Julie Jay: Are you putting your spaces? Are you putting your capital letters?

Julie Jay: At the end of the lesson, remind the children of what they were learning.

Julie Jay: Muaz, how do you know that you were successful today?

Julie Jay: Instead of going activity to activity, where the kids are like, “Now I’m doing this, but I’m not sure why or, like, how this fits,” it’s very clear how the activities relate to the teaching point of the day.

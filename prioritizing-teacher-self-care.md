## Article

Fall-Hamilton Elementary provides social and emotional support for teachers, too—they can call on a peer when they need to step outside their class for a minute or two to center and calm themselves. This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Fall-Hamilton Elementary .

## Transcript

Natalie Vadas: At Fall Hamilton, our common goal here is the children. Sometimes kids are in crisis, and it’s just emotionally draining as a teacher. But at the end of the day, you know that these kids rely on you, so we also need to take care of ourselves. We know you can’t help others until you help yourself. Sometimes you just need a minute. You need to step out of your own room, take a deep breath.

Madisien Steele: As educators, we may be having a rough day, and sometimes we get frustrated too. So we have a tap-in, tap-out strategy here. If something happens in the classroom, teachers have the ability to contact someone on the text chain. If there’s a student that needs some extra support, if the teacher needs extra support, then someone else is able to come in and provide that.

Natalie Vadas: If you need a minute, you can text someone and be like, “Hey, can you cover my class? Can you give me a second?” And we will gladly cover one another.

Madisien Steele: In terms of faculty support, we feel more supported here in this environment because we know that it’s a collaborative effort and everyone is going to be heard.

Student: This is great!

Natalie Vadas: You sometimes just need to ask for help, and it’s okay, and it’s really accepted here, and it’s promoted. No one’s alone, we’re a ship and we run together, and there’s someone always that has your back.

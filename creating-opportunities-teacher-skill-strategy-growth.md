## Article

At P.S. 249, in Brooklyn, New York, educators have leaned into an innovative professional development model called “lab sites” to help each other improve their teaching practice. Once a week, during PD time, teams of teachers get together to explore specific teaching strategies or activities they need help with. Teachers hone their skills by working with a small group of students who volunteer to stay after school, while their grade-level colleagues observe.

Having students be part of the teachers’ experience allows them real-time teaching and learning interactions, while the students get extra academic support. After the students leave, the group provides feedback to the teacher who was being observed on what went well and what still needs work. Teachers implement what they’ve learned in their classrooms later in the week and return the following week to let everyone know how it went.

The teachers at P.S. 249 were first introduced to lab sites in a Teachers College workshop about seven years ago, and they loved working with their peers and the students so much, they adapted it and made it part of their regular professional development. The low-stakes practice builds on the strengths of all teachers and gives new teachers, especially, an opportunity to grow and learn from their peers in a safe, supportive environment.

## Transcript

Rebecca Thomas: All right, that went well. Would you like to give feedback to Miss Allen? And then we can give feedback to Miss Hollings.

Surbyn Martinez: I love how she judged them when she thought it was going to move on to the next step.

Ashley Darling: I think it is very engaging to partner with my teacher peers in understanding different strategies that they’re using in their classroom, being able to say, “The way I’m teaching this isn’t working, so how can we teach this so that all of our kids are successful?” Haslee Cameron: One thing I really like is that you did a lot of partner work. You were really checking in. The kids were giving you really nice answers.

Rebecca Thomas: At P.S. 249, everyone’s so collaborative. The trust is built around taking ideas from one another. Listening to one another.

Ashley Darling: Eyes on me. In three and two and one.

Ana De Jesus: Lab sites are a place where teachers can come together and practice pedagogy. They’re going to research a high-impact instructional strategy and then practice it. It’s low stakes, so teachers are really comfortable providing each other feedback.

Ashley Darling: My focus in this particular lab site was to be more fluent in the drill that we were practicing. I asked a lot of questions to help make sure that they understood.

Ashley Darling: I want you to figure out how many beads there are. You guys ready?

Student: Yeah.

Ashley Darling: Suzanne, how many did you see?

Suzanne: Seven.

Ashley Darling: Brian, how many you see?

Brian: Seven.

Ashley Darling: Somebody show a… Class: Number box.

Ashley Darling: I want to show a number box.

Rebecca Thomas: It’s important to have kids work with us in the lab site, because the kids actually give us real data. What things we need to modify, so that kids of different ability groups can do it successfully.

Ashley Darling: What does the two represent?

Suzanne: The two represents the two white beads.

Ashley Darling: The two white beads.

Rebecca Thomas: The observation sheet is similar to what we get graded on ourselves when we are observed professionally, so we are looking at strategies teachers are using. Different questions teachers are asking. How are kids engaged? You’re still learning and seeing, “I need to do this, too, when it’s my turn with my class.” Ashley Darling: We did fluency practice and then we did center work.

Rebecca Thomas: So, one center was a scaffolding center. And my center was more rigorous.

Rebecca Thomas: Listen carefully because we’re going to play a game to help us decompose. You’re going to put some inside your gingerbread jar. And some inside the plate. You’re going to decompose into parts.

Rebecca Thomas: The challenge was to write an equation to match the parts that they came up with. First I modeled using the language, and then I had to be very intentional about the questions I asked, so they can use the language back.

Rebecca Thomas: What does the three represent, Giovanni?

Giovanni: The three represents the plate.

Rebecca Thomas: Yes, the three in the plate.

Ashley Darling: Teachers at the end of our lab site are coming together, and we’re giving each other feedback. What went well, what are your glows, and what do you need to work on? What are your grows?

Elysia Colgan: You gave a lot of details. You had a lot of active engagement. You weren’t just teaching at them. Teaching the center at them, but they were doing it along with you.

Haslee Cameron: Also, I loved that you like—you used an academic vocabulary word every chance you got. You’re like, would you like to give feedback to Ms. Dunning?

Julie Jay: My one kind of next step was the pacing. Maybe because it’s a fluency routine, making it just a little bit quicker.

Ashley Darling: Part of the feedback that I got was how can I ask questions in a way that doesn’t take so long because this is supposed to be a fast activity.

Haslee Cameron: Next week, we’ll rotate. So, we have our next steps for the next meeting.

Teachers: Thank you!

Ashley Darling: After lab site, I take the feedback and I implement it in my own classroom.

Ashley Darling: Wait, what’s this called?

Class: Reckon rack.

Ashley Darling: It’s a reckon rack activity. Are you guys ready?

Class: Yes!

Ashley Darling: So, what’s this?

Class: Whole.

Rebecca Thomas: Your whole, and these are my— Class: Parts.

Ashley Darling: Does it work or does it not work? And if not, we need to try it again until we make sure that students have an understanding of what we’re teaching.

Rebecca Thomas: Our students definitely benefit from our lab sites, because they always get high-quality work put in front of them. Students are achieving the skill and they’re ready for more.

Ana De Jesus: I think that especially for new teachers, it just a great place for them to be able to practice and get feedback from teachers that have been teaching for more years. So, it creates a really safe place to learn for everyone.

Ashley Darling: Yeah, give yourself a pat pat pat.

Class: On the back back back.

Ashley Darling: Excellent work.

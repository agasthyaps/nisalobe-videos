## Article

At P.S. 249 in Brooklyn, New York, over 20 percent of the students are English as a New Language (ENL) learners, many of them newcomers to the U.S. The school’s diverse population includes children who speak Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, Ukrainian, and Georgian, and many start kindergarten with little or no English. When principal Elisa Brown first came on board in 2000, the school was using a pull-out model to serve these learners.

She quickly noticed that by the time students were picked up from their various classrooms and brought to the specialized language learning teacher, they were getting minimal instruction time—maybe 10 minutes per day. And often, what they were learning was not connected to what was being taught in their regular classroom. Brown decided to implement New York state’s English as a New Language program , formerly known as English as a second language (ESL), throughout the school.

In the ENL model, the content is taught in English using specific instructional strategies by a teacher who is certified to teach English to speakers of other languages (ESOL). This way, students receive a full day of instruction in the regular curriculum, but with support from a teacher who is specially trained to work with language learners. Strategies include using academic vocabulary in different contexts often, using routines for tasks and assignments so that students can anticipate what’s coming up, and using lots of gestures and pictorial cues to help students understand what’s being said.

The school now has a designated ENL classroom with an ESOL-certified teacher for every grade level, starting in kindergarten and up through fifth grade. The switch to the ENL model has paid off—the school says the majority of kindergartners who start at the school with little or no English reach proficiency by the third or fourth grade and test out of language learner status. And the data for P.S. 249’s ENL classes in each grade level is similar to the data from the rest of the grade-level classrooms.

Not only are multilingual students thriving academically, but they are reaching fluency and moving into the regular classrooms at a much higher rate than before.

## Transcript

Julie Jay : Who was successful solving their problem of the day today? Turn and tell your partner. Most of our kids who are classified as ENLs who have started kindergarten in this school test out third, fourth grade. If we can bring the English language learning strategies to the classroom instead of taking the student out of the classroom, the focus really remains on the content and the academics and the child. Student : I was thinking about what the numbers represent and use lots of strategies. Julie Jay : Use strategies. Give yourselves a check. Elisa Brown : At P.S. 249, we have newcomer students that come to the building without speaking any English. We give all the kids what they need so they are learning from the onset. Ana De Jesus : So the traditional way of servicing ENL students was through a pull-out program. We noticed by the time you get to the classroom, so much time has been wasted from picking up students. It was about maybe 10 minutes of instruction. So we decided to have an ENL classroom in each grade where the teacher is ESL certified and students remain in the classroom and get a full day of instruction. Julie Jay : So I teach the reading, the math, the social studies, the science. I teach everything the same as all of the other kindergarten classes. The only difference is that I’ve been trained to teach language learners, and so I incorporate those strategies as I teach the content. Here we go, get out your daily math review. So some of the strategies that I use are gesturing and using pictorial cues. If you think about going to another country and if you don’t speak a language, you find yourself acting things out when you’re communicating with someone. That’s just the natural process. Let me read it again. There are nine ladybugs. Five ladybugs flew away. Even just the small act of doing this, the children can see visually that the five are flying away. How many ladybugs are still on the leaf? Go and solve it. I’m going to set the timer for four minutes. And then when I meet with a small group, it’s using the manipulatives so that they can visualize and access the content that we’re doing. Student : Bye-bye ladybugs! Julie Jay : Five, how many were left? Student : There was nine ladybugs, then five flew away, then there’s four more left. Julie Jay : Another strategy that I use is the intentional use of high-level vocabulary and a lot of repetition. We know that when a word is encountered in many different contexts, many different times, that’s when the word is learned. One word that comes up a lot is the word feedback. Today in the writing lesson, I was teaching how to make your writing easy to read. Does anybody have any feedback for me about how I could make my writing easier to read? Rizwan, what’s your feedback? Student : My feedback is the period. Julie Jay : Oh, I forgot to make my period. Thank you for your feedback. All right, I want you to go get set up for writing workshop. Another strategy we use is routines—using routines is important for any small child because they know what to expect. So, for example, they have the understanding of how the workshop model progresses. We do the mini-lesson, then they go back to their seat, and I call small groups. Student : I am making my pancake. Julie Jay : And then we all come back to the carpet. All right, let’s see who’s ready on the carpet for the clothes. So they are able to anticipate what’s coming up. That just avoids a lot of questioning, like, is it time for lunch, or are we having gym today? So today we worked on what you guys are going to write in your how-to books. Ana De Jesus : What I’ve noticed with this model is by the time that our students are reaching the upper grades, they have already passed the language proficiency test. Julie Jay : We can see the benefits of having the regular curriculum the entire day. We have seven kindergarten classes. You wouldn’t be able to tell that mine is an ENL class. Julie Jay : Good job, guys. Student : I did all of them, I did all of them. Julie Jay : Excellent, good job.

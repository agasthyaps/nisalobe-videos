# How a School Made Play Central to Learning

> At a primary school in the UK, both students and teachers have become more engaged and curious as a result of a shift to a fully play-based approach—and learning has become more joyful for everyone.

## Article

In Aberdeen, Scotland, Dyce Primary School has undergone an impressive academic transformation by making learning more playful. In a wooded area near the school, even the smallest students are free to take risks in an unstructured environment—climbing trees, building structures from tarps, planks, and tires, exploring the landscape—while teachers observe from a distance. Once they are back indoors, the perseverance, independence, and resourcefulness the children developed while at play improve their focus and their academic work, as they dive into hands-on, largely student-directed learning initiatives.

## Transcript

Sarah Law: All right Susan, push this down.

Jenny Watson: Our children are allowed to have a real joy in their day. They’re allowed to have great fun. They’re allowed to laugh. They’re allowed freedom, and this really helps them to be engaged and motivated when they come to school.

Sarah Law: Our school’s gone through a lot of changes. Before the pandemic, it was very structured. We had elements of play throughout the school, but in my classroom anyway, we did a lot of activities rather than play. Play was the reward, rather than the learning.

Sarah Law: Understand?

Children: Yeah.

Sarah Law: OK, are we ready to go and explore?

Children: Yeah.

Sarah Law: Fantastic, OK. Since the pandemic, it has gone more play-based. It’s a lot more child-led, and it’s a lot more fun.

Jenny Watson: So now each class has at least three play experiences every week, and these are timetabled. They’re agreed for by the staff, and they happen in different spaces across the school.

Emma Hart: It’s really helpful to have those sessions actually scheduled in. You know that you’re going to be using it at that time, rather than in previous years, we’ve had the option of having play at a certain time. But it wasn’t structured, so that would be the first thing that could get taken out your timetable if you were falling behind. Now we don’t take it out.

Sarah Law: Having the excitement of the different areas around the school keeps them engaged and keeps them interested. And it’s all around the same idea that they’re focusing on in class.

Sarah Law: Now on our expedition the other day, we were learning all about dams. So you can see if you can use the Play-Doh and the lollipop sticks to make something out of the pictures, and I’ve got some… Megan Ward: Having these hands-on experiences helps them to link what they learn in the classroom into something which they’re doing with their hands, that they’re able to talk to their friends about. When it comes to planning playful experiences, the trick is to not over-plan it. You see so many beneficial outcomes just from setting up an area with different resources for them to explore.

Eilidh Cosgrove: We talk about four main skills: our creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. And I think they’re skills that can’t necessarily be taught by a teacher. So, you know, play allows them to be off exploring that on their own with other children. It’s a time for the adults to step back and the children just take control of what they’re doing. The freedom sometimes can cause them to have conflicts and things, but that’s the beauty of play as well. They’re off, away from adults, developing their skills to resolve conflict on their own.

Emma Hart: We get to see them in a different light at play, and they’re using those skills, those real-world skills, of literacy, numeracy. But they’re using it in a different way. And it’s a way that’s probably more akin to what they will do in the real world outside. The children have a much wider attention span when we come to play. They can go deeper, quicker. It’s also embedding those social skills as well.

Child: Bailey, we’re trying to figure out, because there’s a lump bit in the middle and it might get stuck.

Jenny Watson: So the school’s absolutely been on a journey. We’ve modeled the different play experiences to let the teachers see what is possible.

Megan Ward: So gravity is pulling it towards the ground, and since it’s at a slope, it draws it all the way down that way.

Jenny Watson: And then the teachers have piloted them.

Sarah Law: Where does the electricity go?

Jenny Watson: It’s then allowed us to say, OK, so this is working really well.

Sarah Law: Good job, into houses, well done.

Jenny Watson: So I think it’s got to be a careful process that you don’t overwhelm people by doing everything at once. You let people try it out, see the benefits.

Sarah Law: That’s amazing.

Jenny Watson: Since August this year, we’ve welcomed 80 new students to our school, many of whom are Ukrainians. We are so thankful that these play experiences we have are absolutely embedded in the school, because it’s allowed our children to bond together. We can definitely see a difference in the children’s communication skills, because they are working together. There’s a lot of listening, a lot of talking, a lot of respect shown, listening to other people’s views. You see that engagement, that deep learning that they’re having through play, and that’s so good for their well-being.

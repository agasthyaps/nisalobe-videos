## Article

In Beth Blissett’s middle school math classroom in Eminence, Kentucky, there aren’t any desks in rows. Instead, students are often found standing in groups of three, chattering excitedly, working on math problems together. During an activity inspired by Peter Liljedahl’s thinking classrooms , Blissett divides her students into small random groups, then gives each group a rich math task to work on and a single dry-erase marker.

She then sends the students off to collaborate on vertical nonpermanent surfaces—in her room it’s whiteboards and windows—so they can make their thinking visible. One student starts calculating, using the marker, while the others offer ideas and encouragement. As if in a relay race, periodically Blissett calls out, “Pass the marker!” and the next student builds on the work of the previous one.

Working collaboratively and being able to easily erase can reduce anxiety and make the students more willing to take risks. By the end of the lesson, they’re thinking like mathematicians. To learn more about Peter Liljedahl’s ideas, read his article for Edutopia titled “ Building a Thinking Classroom in Math .” To see more vertical learning, check out the video Learning on Their Feet .

## Transcript

Teacher : Go ahead and switch markers again, please. Teacher : We use the strategy Pass the Marker for accountability and collaboration in math. First we create random groups. We want students to share new ideas, get new strategies. We provide a rich task for students to work on. Next we send them to a nonpermanent vertical surface, which in our case are the whiteboards or the glass walls. Students feel free to try something new, and if it’s incorrect, then just erase it and start all over. Every so often we just have them pass the marker. Teacher : All right, guys, switch markers! Teacher : The students are putting their own ideas down, and another student will build on it. If they’re stuck, other partners are chiming in and helping them. I see a lot more students participating. I see students taking risks, feeling comfortable. They like math. Student : Good job!

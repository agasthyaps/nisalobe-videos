## Article

A common practice—reading logs—may also sap a student’s motivation to read, according to a 2012 study . When students were required to track the number of minutes they read, their interest and attitudes toward reading fell dramatically. So what can teachers do instead?

Allie Thrower, a fifth-grade teacher, ditched the reading logs and paired students together who would challenge each other academically while being emotionally supportive. With a few guiding questions, such as “Which character do you most closely relate to, and why?” many of her students stopped seeing reading as a chore and became excited about sharing their latest reading adventures with their partners.

## Transcript

Narrator: To promote recreational reading, many teachers mandate that students read for 20 minutes every day and log their progress. But a 2012 study shows that mandatory reading logs can actually demotivate students. In the study, students who were required to read, expressed more negative attitudes about recreational reading than those encouraged to read voluntarily. Researchers concluded that reading logs were ineffective in furthering a love of reading and may even lead to a decrease in children’s motivation to read. The findings are consistent with other studies that show that evaluation, deadlines and surveillance can undermine intrinsic motivation. Some teachers are moving to strategies that make reading feel less like a chore and give students more ownership and autonomy. It’s a simple step, but allows students to choose their own books, at least sometimes, to create stronger interest in reading and periodically lets students read just for pleasure with no formal follow-up. Pair students for regular chat about what they’ve read and teach them how to be good partners and hold peers accountable for their reading. Model how to talk about books by having students answer questions like, “What feelings did this book evoke for you? Which character do you most closely relate to?” Boost engagement by avoiding formal grading. Instead, pair students who will challenge each other academically and encourage each other emotionally. Designate a bulletin board or chalkboard as a graffiti space for inspiring quotes from books. First, discuss the standards for a great quote with your students. Then let students nominate quotes from their independent reading. Quotes added to the board can be used to spark productive reading conversations in the classroom.

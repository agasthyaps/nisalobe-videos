# Boosting Math Skills With Daily Practice

> Adding an extra period of math every day gives students an opportunity to review what they’ve learned and strengthen their mathematical thinking.

## Article

Every class starts each day at P.S. 249, the Caton School, in Brooklyn, with a 45-minute period of math practice—from kindergarten to fifth grade. In the first half, students review concepts they learned previously, and then they jump into solving the problem of the day, a complex multistep problem that relates to their current unit. Students work independently, then review their work together as a group, which allows them to make their thinking visible, share out different ways of approaching the problem, and use all their math vocabulary.

All of this is data-driven and crafted by the school’s teachers: Grade-level teacher teams work together each week to assess what standards students need more work on, using the previous week’s math review worksheets, quizzes, and exit tickets as sources of data. They then design math review worksheets for the week ahead, as well as pick one extra-juicy problem for each day. This additional period of practicing math is paying off: The Caton School was the top math performer in their district in the 2022–23 school year, with 76 percent of students proficient or higher, an increase of 15 percentage points over the year before—and doubling down on math has built a community of enthusiastic and creative math thinkers there.

Casey Lomonaco : What I want to remind you of your job today, some of you are going to be sharing your work, right? If you’re not someone who’s sharing today, I want you to make sure that you’re giving some specific feedback. I think it’s beneficial that math review and problem of the day have become a schoolwide practice because it helps students revisit the math that they are struggling with or practice higher-level thinking in math. Hands up or thumbs up if you have an idea. It really just strengthens our mathematicians. Ana De Jesus : The vision of P.S. 249 is that every student will be proficient or advanced in reading, writing, and mathematics, and it is our job to make that happen. When you enter this building, you’re going to see everyone participating in math review and problem of the day, every day from kindergarten all the way to fifth grade. Casey Lomonaco : So the math review is just as it sounds. It’s a review of the things that we have covered throughout the year. So everybody’s working independently right now with their regular pencil, showing all of their mathematical thinking. Khloe : Math review is with six boxes, and each box has a different math problem. So in one box, it could be time. The other box, it could be multiplication, division. Casey Lomonaco : So the boxes throughout the week become much more rigorous, and then on Friday, they hand it in as a quiz that we use then to pick the next boxes for the following week. All righty, everybody, please move on to problem of the day if you have not already. So problem of the day is like math review’s best friend. This juicy, meaty problem and that problem is related to our current unit. Khloe : Today’s problem of the day was doing fractions. When we first read the problem, we underline the facts so that we don’t miss a step. Casey Lomonaco : In the second box, they’re showing all of their math thinking. Toshiro : Well, you do need to show a model on how you answer that question. Giving the answer isn’t good enough because you need proof to explain that answer. Casey Lomonaco : My job is to circle around and ask students who have an exemplar piece to share or to explain their thinking. All right, get your math review and your problem of the day. Please remember to grab your colored pencil. So when we’re on the rug, students have a chance to review their work. The kids are able to explain how they solved a problem. Before we review it, I will give students an opportunity to share with a partner or to do a quick turn and talk. Student : If you have four pieces, you’re going to have to share with more people and stuff, and when you have three pieces, you have the bigger piece. Casey Lomonaco : For today, I selected two students who drew their models in a different way, and I put them under the document camera. So this is one of the models drawn by Toshiro; here’s another model drawn by Zafran. Casey Lomonaco : And the goal was for them to have to make sure that the models are the same size and that you’re not comparing models that are different, and so it really sparked that conversation. Math Review and POD Block really provides a level of consistency for them. Students work collaboratively, kids are getting feedback from each other, and I think it really helps students take ownership of their mathematical thinking.

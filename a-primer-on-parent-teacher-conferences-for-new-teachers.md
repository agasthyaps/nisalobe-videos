## Article

For new teachers, getting ready for parent-teacher conferences can be overwhelming. With so many things to accomplish in such a short period of time, it’s hard to know where to even begin. But with intentional preparation, teachers can create communicative, collaborative, and positive experiences for everyone—from the very beginning prep stages to the follow-up.

The more teachers make the process accessible, the higher the likelihood that caregivers will show up and contribute to helping support their student’s growth. Families can be brought in with simple communication tools before conferences even begin. Planning ahead for translators where needed and providing families context about their child’s progress in advance helps them prepare to engage in conversation, which ensures that the meetings are more collaborative and equitable.

At the beginning of the conference, it’s normal for both teachers and parents to be nervous. Following a plan allows teachers to focus on addressing each family’s needs and share succinct updates. A good rule to help ease tensions off the top is to begin each meeting by highlighting the student’s strengths.

And while the conversation can sometimes get stuck on grades and student performance, there are ways teachers can shift the emphasis away from grades and toward goals of growth in both social and emotional learning and academic subject areas. An icebreaker like stars and stairs or an activity where teacher and parent take turns sharing the top three adjectives that come to mind when describing the student can also provide structure. Sharing reflections in turns can help guide the conversation and ensure that families are talking for at least a third of the meeting.

One powerful strategy is to invite students to co-lead one conference in the year. This gives students the opportunity to be active in their learning and growth and helps them sharpen their presentation skills. Teachers can support students to create their own presentations for their families by offering template examples and having them share “proud pieces” and “growth pieces” they’ve chosen themselves.

Concluding the session with a “growth contract” can provide a space where students can write out their goals for the next quarter and a place where caregivers and teachers can articulate how they will support their student to achieve these goals. Ultimately, it is important to see families as key contributors and partners in helping teachers do their jobs better—and gaining insights that can support students to achieve their potential is an invaluable aspect of conferences.

## Transcript

Narrator : Planning for family-teacher conferences as a new teacher can be stressful. How do you shift the emphasis from grades to growth? What would make your conferences more collaborative and equitable? Here are some ideas on how to make the most of them and keep nerves at bay. The more you can make the process of family-teacher conferences accessible, the higher the likelihood for positive and productive experiences for everyone. Send a link to a scheduling app directly to parents to select times and dates that you are available, with options for in-person, Zoom, or phone meetings, to accommodate families who may need it. Schedule reminder emails to avoid no-shows. Confirm which families need language support, and make sure an interpreter is available for the meeting. Whenever possible, provide families context about their child’s progress ahead of time so they’re ready to engage in conversation. It’s normal for both teachers and parents to be nervous, but following a conference plan allows you to focus on addressing each family’s needs and share succinct updates. Create a template agenda and stick to it. For example, you can ease tensions off the top by highlighting the student’s strengths. Consider following this with an activity like stars and stairs. Stars are where the student excels, and stairs are where they need more work. Take turns sharing your reflections to help guide the conversation, and make sure families are talking for at least one-third of the meeting. Even if there is an interpreter, maintain eye contact with the families. Lastly, follow up to stay connected. This could be a quick phone call, text, or email to get feedback and share progress updates. Gaining insights from families that can support your students to achieve their potential is an invaluable aspect of conferences. Conferences happen several times a year. Though it takes some planning, asking students to co-lead one of them with you can motivate them to be active in their learning and not passive recipients of grades. Have students create a presentation for their families that includes proud pieces and growth pieces they’ve chosen themselves. To close, cocreate a growth contract by having students write out their goals for the next quarter. Have a column for family members to write notes on how they will support the students, and add your own. These contracts provide measures of accountability and a shared investment between students, teachers, and families. With intentional planning, family-teacher conferences can help you build and maintain supportive and communicative relationships that last all year long.

Narrator: Games in the classroom can provide a more collaborative, engaging experience for all students. According to research, games can help increase student participation, foster social and emotional learning, and motivate students to take risks. Games require players to make quick decisions in a low-risk setting, which can boost their confidence to tackle learning challenges later on. To get kids with grapple with unfamiliar new perspectives, have them inhabit different personas and then experience the impact of their choices. Or bring in games on topics that students might otherwise shy away from, as a low-pressure way to explore new interests. Because games are fun, students may not even realize how much they’re learning. Make over a traditional lesson by crafting a compelling storyline to draw the kids in. Or gamify the lesson by weaving in game components like points, leader boards and badges to harness the competitive spirit. When students are researching a topic, send them on a quest, a good way to get them more hyped up than with a typical assignment. Games can increase equity in the classroom by giving every child an entry point to participate. Find games with different difficulty levels, from notice to expert, to increase the likelihood of all students joining in. For students who struggle to engage with traditional assignments, digital scoreboards can provide motivation. Try setting fun low-stakes goals, like most creative error. Multiplayer games like Minecraft and Among Us encourage players to collaborate and create strong relationships with peers. To foster camaraderie among students, assign them to rotating pairs or teams for gameplay. If you’re going to integrate gaming for the first time, start small. Think about the mix of games you use and the range of emotions they can provoke. And remember, not everything needs to be gamified.

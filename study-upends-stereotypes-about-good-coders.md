In Chantel S. Prat, Tara M. Madhyastha, Malayka J.

Mottarella, and Chu-Hsuan Kuo’s 2020 study on how natural language aptitude affects the ability to learn programming languages , the authors found that learning to code had more in common with learning a language than it had with solving math problems—an outcome that holds the potential to make us reconsider our ideas of what kind of skills might make for the best coders and programmers.

## Transcript

What’s the formula for a good coder? Most people think that you just add a few parts math to a few parts science and technology that math plus technology equals coder. But a new study found that learning how to code more closely resembles learning a language like French, or Chinese. In the study, young adults learned a popular computer programing language, then took a series of tests assessing their problem-solving math and language skills. The researchers discovered that math skills accounted for only two percent of a person’s ability to learn coding. Whereas language skills were almost nine times more predictive of ability, accounting for 17 percent of the difference between strong and weak programmers. The research chips away at ingrained stereotypes that have closed our minds and closed doors to future programmers in school and in workplaces, and begins to paint a new, more inclusive picture of what a coder could look like.

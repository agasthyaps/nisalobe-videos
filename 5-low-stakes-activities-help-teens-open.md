Getting to know your students is one of the most crucial parts of a new school year. Yet, as teens get older, it can become more difficult to get them to share about themselves. These five fresh but simple prompts make opening up easy and fun for middle and high school students.

To learn more about these ideas, read ESL teacher Valentina Melnikova’s Edutopia article from June 2022, “ 6 Ways to Get to Know Your Students and Build a Classroom Community. ” The research cited in the video is Garvin Brod, Markus Werkle-Bergner, and Yee Lee Shing’s 2013 article “ The Influence of Prior Knowledge on Memory: A Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Perspective .”

## Transcript

Narrator: Getting to know your students is key to keeping them engaged throughout the year, both in the material you’re teaching and in the classroom community. You can build rapport with your students with these low-pressure activities that invite them to share their personalities and their passions; then you can map those interests back to your curriculum. Research shows it’s easier to take in new material when it’s related to something you already know.

Narrator: This activity doesn’t take much time or prep, yet it gives you a chance to immediately make connections. Have students take turns sharing two things they like and one thing they don’t. It’s a simple prompt that gives you a window into your students’ preferences and sparks authentic reactions from classmates as they find common ground. Licorice—yuck, right?

Narrator: A unity quilt is a visual representation of the diversity in your classroom. Have each student create their own personalized square from collaged photos or magazine clippings to represent their unique interests. You can assemble the quilt in class if you’re using paper, or you can build it digitally. This gives you a bird’s-eye view of the most common themes so you can build a lesson around something your students are excited about.

Narrator: This get-to-know-you exercise revolves around a handful of books from the library. It doesn’t matter what they are, although suggesting books at the right level for your class may inspire students to keep on reading long after the task is over. Students choose a book they most identify with based on title, color scheme, cover art, or the name of the author. Anything will do. Then they present their choice to the rest of the class. As a bonus, you get to introduce students to lesser-known items from the library.

Narrator: Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary has a Time Traveler webpage. You can choose a year and see which words showed up in the dictionary for the first time. Have students pick a word from their birth year, something that resonates for them, and share their thoughts aloud. This promotes literacy skills and creativity as students connect seemingly random words to their own lives.

Narrator: Music can be an excellent entry point for conversations about life experiences and identity. Ask students to look up the top song from the day they were born. Choose a line that relates to their lives and share it. This may initiate some interesting discussions about universal themes in former hits and could even inspire an impromptu dance party.

Narrator: Offering low-stakes ways for students to share as much or as little as they’re comfortable with establishes relationships and builds community right out of the gate, which could improve student engagement in your content all year long.

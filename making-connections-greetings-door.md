## Transcript

Falon Turner: Hi, let’s get a hug.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: The driver for learning is the social connection. Activating a child’s cognitive skills begins with activating their social connectedness. Children in this school are starting the day with an adult saying to them, “I see you, I know you, I’m connecting with you, and you’re important to me.” Falon Turner: We start each day by greeting every kid at the door. Good morning, Douglas.

Douglas: You look pretty, Miss Turner!

Falon Turner: Thank you, baby. Every classroom does some variation of would you like a high-five, handshake, or hug? Essentially, it’s “What greeting would you like?” How you doing, handsome?

Child: Good.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: There is a great deal of cultural sensitivity and empowerment for children to say, “Here is how I want to greet you.” Falon Turner: High-five, handshake or hug? You got your hair done?

Molly: Hug.

Falon Turner: Good morning, Molly. You got your hair done? Let me see, turn around. I love it. All right, we gonna have a good day today? All right. High-give, handshake or hug? During that time, I’m just trying to connect with them, help them from their transition from home to school and just kind of– it’s kind of like a pulse check to see where they are. Oh! I knew you wanted a hug. Arrrgh! How you feeling today, sir?

Child: Good.

Falon Turner: Are we going to have a good day? Look in my eyes. Do they look escalated, do they look triggered, do they look upset? So, this is a way for me to see, okay, who needs to be where, how can I help, how can I be of assistance to start their day off most effectively? Good morning, Ariella! How you doing today?

Ariella: Good.

Falon Turner: I’m being very intentional about my interactions with students, right? So, it’s not just I’m in the back of the room, “Hey, come in.” No, I’m making connection with them. I have eye contact with them. I’m checking in on how they’re doing. I’m checking to make sure they’re okay. Good morning, friends.

Children: Good morning, friends.

Falon Turner: I think the impact is deep relationships. I get to know my students. I get to check in with them. I get to find out something about them. They get to find out something about me. We get to make a connection and that starts with the greeting at the door. All right, come on in.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: So, a child is walking in the door feeling cared for, empowered and encouraged, and that teacher is focusing in on who that child is, and that’s how the day starts.

“I want to start the year off hopeful,” says high school English teacher Cathleen Beachboard. Beachboard is a firm believer in the value of taking the time to connect with students at the beginning of the year. But she noticed when she changed from teaching middle school to high school recently that teens benefited from additional get-to-know-you activities.

“A lot of the time teenagers feel like they’re not in control, that their parents, guardians, teachers, they are the ones in control of how they’ll do things, when they’ll do things.” Beachboard had an aha moment when one student reported feeling “stuck” in the present. Beachboard started thinking about what might help students feel more connected to their dreams and passions, their future selves (for related research, see this study ). And so, the Future Goals Gala was born.

This 30-year class reunion (held 30 years early) asks students to come as the people they plan to be—and bring props to prove it (students have brought everything from the New York Times bestseller books they’ve written to photo albums of their future families to Olympic gold medals). While her students are having fun mingling with their classmates, Beachboard takes notes—and uses the information she’s gleaned about her students during the rest of the year, incorporating students’ interests into the books and activities she chooses. She also groups students together based on common interests, which helps them break out of their social groups in the classroom.

“Kids need to remember the reason we go to school is not to get a job—it’s to empower you to become the person and the dream self that you ultimately want to be in the future,” Beachboard says. The Future Goals Gala “reminds them that they have the agency, they are growing into this person, and it gives them the push and desire to start putting forth the effort to become the person they’re going to be—and lets them know that they will be in complete control very soon.” Beachboard has made a downloadable PDF of her Future Goals Gala information sheet available for other educators to use.

Cathleen Beachboard: Hi. I’m Cathleen Beachboard, and I teach English for high school. A lot of the time, teenagers feel like they’re not in control, but by giving someone the idea of their future goals, it reminds them that they can control the person they hope to be. And so I started “The Future Goals Gala.” It helps me connect with my students based off of their dreams and future passions, and it gets them thinking about all those things that matter to them. I plan the Gala during the first week of school, and I explain to the students that we’re going to have a 30-year class reunion in the classroom. Teenagers really enjoy this, and especially when you tell them it’s a party. I send home a guiding info sheet. Some of the questions are, like, think about yourself 30 years from now. What places do you really hope to go to? Or what kind of impact do you hope to have in your community in your field of study? And so by thinking about all of those things, they create the persona of the person they’re going to become. And it also has a timeline to look at all of those things they want to accomplish. How are they going to get there? How does education fit in with that? So on the actual day, I hang up a giant banner that says, “30 Year Class Reunion,” and I fill champagne glasses with apple juice. Then the students come in and introduce themselves as the person they’ve become. It’s really funny, because they’re like, “I haven’t seen you in years. How are you, John?” I ask them to bring materials of proof of their future successful life. And so, they will bring in Photoshopped pictures of themselves on Mount Everest; their cure for cancer in a vial; a cake that they decided to make as a Michelin chef. As I get introduced to this future amazing person, I take notes on the things that they tell me, like, “Oh, I’m doing work in Uganda and I’m building wells.” And I’m like, “Wow.” And then my job as the teacher is to interweave those components into the semester. So as an English teacher, I choose stories based off of their passion. So I have a student who’s really interested in birds. I will do a whole lesson where we’ll read something about birds and they can be the expert in the room. For a teacher who says, “This seems like a lot of extra work,” it is, but it’s worth it because this gives them motivation to be in school for what they’re doing in the classroom, showing that you are invested not just in the student for their education, but you’re invested in the person they’re going to become.

When teacher Nicole Bolduc, of Ellington, Connecticut, wanted more kids to engage and speak up in her middle school science classes, she decided to get random. First, she taped playing cards to the desks of each seating group of four students, and then she created a laminated spinner with the four card suits’ symbols drawn on it. Each time she prompted her class to answer a question, she spun the wheel—and whether it landed on hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs, the students with that card taped to their desk were on the hook to respond.

“I was trying to figure out a way to vary who was participating in the classroom because some students are very reluctant to share. But I didn’t want to cold-call, so I began using a strategy called ‘the spinner,’” says Nicole. “It increases equity of who shares without raising the anxiety of my students.” For more strategies on making class participation more inclusive, check out Hoa Nguyen’s Edutopia article “ How to Open Class Participation to Everyone .”

## Transcript

Nicole Bolduc: One thing I’m going to do before we share is we are going to spin, so the shape that gets picked, you’re going to report out for your group.

Nicole Bolduc: I was trying to figure out a way to vary who was participating in the classroom.

Nicole Bolduc: All right, we have diamonds.

Nicole Bolduc: So I use a strategy called “the spinner.” It increases equity of who shares without raising the anxiety of my students. First I put one card at each student’s spot, and then I drew the different symbols on a magnetic spinner. I give the students a prompt.

Nicole Bolduc: What resources are we going to use to help us today? Then we’ll spin, and one of you will report out for your group.

Nicole Bolduc: I always tell students ahead of time that I’m going to spin the wheel. I want students to all be invested so that they’re all prepared, just in case it’s them.

Nicole Bolduc: I’m going to go ahead and spin. We’re going to go with diamond.

Nicole Bolduc: Whatever shape it lands on is the student that needs to share.

Nicole Bolduc: So a diamond over there.

Boy: I wrote the posters up on the wall.

Nicole Bolduc: Yeah.

Nicole Bolduc: Because we use the spinner strategy, there’s more students speaking up and more ideas being shared from everyone.

# Making Use of a Worked Example to Improve Learning

## Article

It’s a familiar moment in math class—students are asked to solve a problem, and some jump in confidently while others freeze, unsure where to begin. When students don’t yet have a clear mental model for how a problem works, asking them to “figure it out” can lead to confusion rather than understanding. In fourth-grade teacher Susan Hamilton’s classroom at Lincoln Elementary School in Delta, Colorado, that uncertainty is addressed through a strategy called worked examples .

When introducing a new concept, Hamilton begins by modeling a problem step-by-step using the overhead projector, thinking aloud as students watch. At first, students simply observe her process, focusing on the steps and what a successful solution looks like. Gradually, she invites them to participate—completing parts of the problem with her before trying a new one independently.

This scaffolded approach is intentional. When a concept is first being established, learners need clarity about what the steps are and how an expert approaches them. As Jim Heal of Learning Science Partners explains, “A worked example eradicates ambiguity by naming explicitly what the steps are.” This helps students focus their attention on understanding the process rather than guessing what to do next.

As Hamilton slowly fades away her support, students’ thinking becomes more visible. When students begin working independently, it’s clear who understands the strategy and where others are getting stuck. In this lesson, Hamilton quickly notices that several students are struggling with regrouping, and she returns to that specific step, showing the process again before moving on.

When learning is broken into manageable pieces and responsibility is gradually transferred to students, worked examples reduce cognitive overload and build confidence. The strategy not only supports students as they learn new material, but also gives teachers timely insight into misconceptions—making it a powerful tool for classrooms across content areas and grade levels. This video is part of our How Learning Happens series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Dr.

Jim Heal: When you are first establishing a concept, it’s not enough just to tell learners to discover their way to understanding.

Susan Hamilton: Today, we’re going to be dividing two-digit dividends by one-digit divisors.

Dr.

Jim Heal: A worked example eradicates all ambiguity by naming explicitly what the steps are and how the teacher who is an expert would go about moving through those steps.

Susan Hamilton: And we’re going to start off with some worked examples that you guys can do. For years it was like, “Well, you need to let your students do more exploratory learning and just let them discover it for their own.” And that didn’t really work well, at least not for me. They just didn’t know what to do. They didn’t have enough information and they were overwhelmed. So remember, when we’re doing worked examples, your eyes are on the screen and you are watching what I’m doing. And then when it’s your turn, I’ll let you know. A worked example is when you explicitly teach students, starting with an example that you just model to them. Eyes on screen. You model the steps and you’re showing them very clearly, very explicitly what you are looking for, what you’re expecting, and making sure that it’s tied to the understanding. I see my divisor. I know I need four groups. One, two, three, four. OK, now I’m going to… So the first example was just wanting the students to look at the screen to be watching what I was doing. So now I want you to work this problem with me. Don’t do a step until I do a step. Then they need to do it with me. 52 divided by 4. Class, go ahead and write that in your book. I did a step, then they did it. Then I did a step, then they did it. What’s the answer to a division equation called class?

Students: Quotients.

Susan Hamilton: And then the next example I left out just telling what the quotient was. I can see the quotient. I can see my answer.

Dr.

Jim Heal: A faded worked example fades away the level of structured support that that initial example provides. What does this do? It means that the student incrementally takes greater control, ownership, and understanding of those processes.

Susan Hamilton: Brittyn, what is our quotient?

Brittyn: 13.

Susan Hamilton: Right. Yeah. You have the right model. Then I released them to just go ahead, and they showed the regrouping and then the equation. Hey, I’m going to give you about one more minute because I see a lot of people are stuck on the regrouping part. It was very obvious right away who was getting it, who wasn’t getting it, and what they weren’t getting. They were struggling with the concept of regrouping.

Dr.

Jim Heal: So when you provide a worked example to a group of students and then invite them to start to make their own sense of the steps, it can quickly identify where student misconceptions might lie. In this case, the teacher was able to identify that a majority of students were falling down on one of those steps. That enabled her to return to that piece, to use, once again, the logic of a worked example to be able to reinforce that part of the process.

Susan Hamilton: It makes the steps really clear to them, and they don’t feel overwhelmed by too much going on. They’re only having to work with this small amount, and hopefully it’s going to keep their brain from being overloaded with too much information. A lot of you did get done.

Dr.

Jim Heal: And eventually, the student will be able to do it in much the same way that the teacher did.

Susan Hamilton: Erase your boards. Nice job, ladies and gentlemen.

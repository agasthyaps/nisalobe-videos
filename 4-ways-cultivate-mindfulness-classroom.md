## Transcript

Narrator: Cultivating mindfulness in the classroom has both physical and psychological benefits, including increased concentration and engagement and an improvement in self-awareness and self-esteem. Here are four activities to introduce mindfulness to your students.

Narrator: One of the symptoms of stress is shallow breathing. Practicing controlled breathing during a tense situation or in the hectic moments before class starts helps students learn how to regulate their own emotions with awareness. Ask students to inhale through their nose as you count out loud for 5 seconds and then exhale for 5 seconds. Repeat this for a total of three full breaths. You can do this activity with students sitting down or standing up. You can also suggest they put their hands on their stomach to feel the air as it moves in and out, which may help them concentrate.

Narrator: A body scan is a way to bring awareness to what your whole body is feeling and to alleviate any tension. Ask everyone to close their eyes and take a few deep breaths to relax, then lead them through a verbal scan of their body. Start with the toes and work your way up. Say something like “Let your feet relax, releasing any tension you feel there. Now, go up to your ankles; notice any sensations.” Keep going until you reach the head. If you don’t want to lead the meditation yourself, you can find body scan meditation apps or videos. Afterwards, students should take a moment to come back gradually to the classroom. They should feel more energized and ready for learning.

Narrator: This activity helps regulate emotions when kids are feeling anxious or overwhelmed. It can also help a whole class settle down. Shifting attention away from worried thoughts to the immediate surroundings can reset the brain, so students can get back to learning. Start with a deep breath, and ask each of the following questions out loud, pausing to give students time to silently think of their answers. Ask, “What are five things you see, four things you’re touching, three things you hear, two things you smell, one thing you taste?” This exercise allows students to focus on their senses, connecting with their body and the environment in the present moment.

Narrator: With a daily or weekly gratitude practice, students learn how to identify what they’re thankful for. Gratitude has been shown to bolster the quality of our relationships, increase the joy and optimism in our lives, and reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation. Set aside the last 5 minutes of class. Ask students to think of something or someone they appreciate in their life and be as specific as possible. Students can write down their responses or turn and talk with a partner, or ask for volunteers in a large group to share aloud. With practice, students may find that paying attention to what they’re grateful for will help boost their overall self-esteem and well-being as well as contribute to a positive classroom culture.

## Article

Conventional teaching wisdom suggests that tests are a necessary evil without much benefit for learners, but in fact, low-stakes tests actually change and enhance memory. Many teachers still think that students should be taught according to their preferred learning styles—but there’s no evidence to support this. And while it may seem that helping students pick up material easily will make the learning stick, engaging them in productive struggle has proven much more effective.

## Transcript

Narrator: Keeping track of all the research around education can be difficult. It’s easy to get attached to common misconceptions that can actually hinder students’ learning. Here are three learning myths it’s time to ditch so you can better support your students.

Narrator: Tests are often viewed as a necessary evil that help track what students do and do not know. But tests don’t just assess memory—tests change memory. As students retrieve information from long-term memory during a low-stakes quiz, those memories become more resistant to forgetting. Practicing retrieval helps students organize information in their minds and recognize what they’ve understood and what they haven’t. Consider ending class with a brain dump where students write down everything they remember, or have students solve a warm-up question about last week’s lesson using nothing but their memories.

Narrator: There’s a persistent belief that students learn best when instruction is tailored to their preferred style. Some students may say they learn best visually, others verbally, others kinesthetically. But there is no evidence that students learn better when material is presented in a way that matches their preferences. Instead, research shows that students learn, remember, and apply new information better when it’s presented in a variety of formats. For best effect, incorporate diverse examples and varied activities into your units. Engage as many senses as possible, with visuals, sounds, tactile experiences, and movement and yes, maybe even things to smell or taste.

Narrator: It’s often assumed that if students pick up material easily, then it will be easy for them to remember it later. But research suggests that the opposite is more likely. Easily learned often means easily forgotten. Try building opportunities for productive struggle into your lessons instead. Give out practice problems spanning across all the topics you’ve covered this year, not just whatever you taught most recently, and throw in some ungraded questions that are just beyond students’ reach to engage them in deeper problem-solving. Students will make more mistakes in the moment, but reflecting on those mistakes and growing from them will better equip them for success later on.

In a place-based course called Erie Experience, Fairview High School students in Fairview, Pennsylvania, learn about all things local, from ecology to economy. In the Urban Legends unit, they learn the value—and the pitfalls—of oral history, as they dig into some of their region’s most salacious supernatural tales. History teacher and librarian Benjamin Barbour often starts this unit with a game of telephone, to demonstrate how stories change from one teller to the next.

Students then get the opportunity to examine primary and secondary source documents behind the urban legends, and they think about how and why the legends have changed over time, which sharpens their critical thinking skills. “I’m very interested in the stories in our area,” says Barbour. “These are often fantastic stories, supernatural stories, but I look at them as very, very important historical elements, whether they’re true or not.

They tell us, the listener, something about the community. So they’re, to me, very profound psychological and sociological tools to learn about people in a specific region.” After learning about these stories in the classroom, students head out on a field trip to the actual sites of these legends. Visiting these historical places in their own backyard makes the stories all the more real and cements students’ learning about how to find the grains of truth in sensational tales from the past.

What else do students get out of this unit (besides having fun)? ”These stories tell us something about the community. What that community values. What that community fears.

It tells us about the prejudices at the time. The biases. It’s a gateway to understanding history,” Barbour says.

Ultimately, he hopes that learning a little more about local history—and the context around these colorful urban legends—will translate into students’ feeling a stronger connection to their community. For more information about this lesson, see Barbour’s article for Edutopia, “ What Students Can Learn From Studying Urban Legends .”

## Transcript

Benjamin Barbour: Some of the things associated with the site are whispering the voices of the young girl. People have reported feeling pockets of cold air.

Benjamin Barbour: Learning about urban legends has helped my students to appreciate how storytelling has shaped their community’s identity. This has been a really important part of local culture. Even if the stories themselves are not true, the question then becomes, do these stories matter?

Benjamin Barbour: My mission as a teacher is to build responsible citizens, not only at the national level, but also the local level, maybe volunteering, voting, and trying to make their city a better place. Erie Experience is a place-based course. We talk about ecology, economy, culture.

Alex: Learning about local history is important because we wouldn’t really be a community without it.

Benjamin Barbour: Okay, everybody.

Alex: Recently, we’ve been learning about urban legends in our area.

Benjamin Barbour: These stories usually have some kind of a supernatural element. They are often very sensational. And tell us something about the people in a specific region. Now we’re going to look at three urban legends in our community, and we’re going to trace how these stories evolved, how they spread, and if there’s any component of truth.

Alex: On each board in the classroom, there was a different primary source on different urban legends. The first one that I had was the UFO sighting one. An Air Force investigation team may come to Erie to probe mysterious events… Benjamin Barbour: This story emerged during the Cold War when there was a lot of fears about aerial weaponry. These primary sources are very critical to understand these urban legends. They’re learning about the context, they’re learning about the time.

Alex: The second one was Axe Murder Hollow, which is one of the more well-known ones around here. This guy named William Gack. Supposedly he killed this family.

Benjamin Barbour: We know he historically, there is no truth to this actually, but there are stories of kids hearing strange things, seeing the deceased family. Speaker 1: Teenagers are stupid. Let’s just put it that way. We will believe anything.

Alex: The urban legend really started with these teenage kids who snuck into his house and saw all these knives, all these axes, but it’s now known that he was a butcher. So it all makes sense.

Benjamin Barbour: And lastly, the story of Gudgeonville Bridge. A young girl that fell off a cliff near the bridge. And there are many stories about a sensation that you’re going to be pushed off the bridge.

Student: We thought fear inspired the legacy of these stories, and the more tragic the incident is, the more likely it is to be remembered or serve as a warning.

Benjamin Barbour: Having a fun time can help students retain this information. They’re going to remember these experiences. This is our first stop. This is Gudgeonville Bridge.

Alex: We actually had to go onto the bridge to see where the girl jumped. After that, we went to Axe Murder Hollow.

Benjamin Barbour: These very woods are where it happened.

Alex: Going to the place where it occurred, and then seeing the William Gack’s actual grave. And it just made it all the more real than it was just reading on a piece of paper.

Benjamin Barbour: Why do you think I am teaching you urban legends, this material?

Student: Well, with these ton of stories, I feel like we feel more connected in our community and maybe to each other because we can make connections to these stories… Benjamin Barbour: I really want students to realize that when they’re driving down the street or taking a walk in their neighborhood, that these places are important. These stories are a gateway to helping students know a little more about their community. It makes them excited. That excitement could translate into real action, to real concern, to real care about these places we call home.

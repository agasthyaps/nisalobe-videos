## Article

As part of her lesson on fake news at Fairview High School in Fairview, Pennsylvania, social studies teacher Nikki Nies relies on a punny, well-used acronym: CRAP, which stands for currency, relevance, authority, and purpose. With so much information out there (including teens’ main source of news, social media), she wants students to know how to evaluate what they’re seeing and assess the credibility of their news. “So we’re identifying the crap, by using the acronym CRAP,” Nies tells them.

Currency refers to the publication date of the article—to help her students see why this matters, Nies fesses up to her generation’s penchant for sharing outdated articles on Facebook. Relevance means students should check to see if there are other articles about the same topic in the news. Are other sources talking about this?

Authority refers to the author and the publication. “This is one of the biggest tips I can give you,” she tells her students. “Google who the author is.

Are they credible? Or is Joe Schmo nowhere on the internet?” Purpose refers to the intent of the article—is it to inform? Entertain?

Or is it out to persuade or sell something? One requirement for her current events and media literacy class is that students must bring a recent article each day. Nies teaches them to use the CRAP acronym to dissect its reliability.

To go deeper, she has students answer questions about their daily article using her “How Reliable Is Your Article?” worksheet , which guides them through the components of the CRAP acronym. She also introduces them to resources like AllSides and the Ad Fontes Media Bias Matrix , which shows them where their sources fall on the political spectrum. Why is this important?

“I think we have a very polarized United States,” says Nies. “And I think it’s very easy to find articles or news sources that will support your theories on certain things. So that news is out there.

But it’s understanding the reliability of that source, before we are quick to say that as a fact.” To see more of Nies’s comprehensive lesson on sniffing out misinformation and assessing credibility of news sources, watch the video Giving Students the Skills to Spot Fake News .

## Transcript

Nikki Nies: We’ve talked about fake news, we’ve talked about media bias. What I want you to do is take the article that you brought today and we’re going to practice using the acronym, CRAP. My curriculum is very student-driven. I want to teach what they’re interested in, and I want to help them understand those things, so that they leave my room educated citizens. Every day in my class, the students have to come prepared with an article that interests them. So today, we talked about CRAP, which is our acronym for spotting fake news. The first part of this is C. CRAP stands for currency—when was the article written? A lot of people in my age group are guilty of seeing something on Facebook and resharing an article. And when you check the publication date, you’re like, “That happened in the city five years ago.” Relevance—does it relate to what I am seeing and hearing in the news? Have you heard multiple sources or multiple websites talk about this? If you look up that the hurricane is coming, can you find that across multiple news sources? Authority—dealing with the author and the publication it came from. This is one of the biggest tips I can give you guys. Google who the author is. Are they credible? Or is Joe Schmo nowhere on the internet? And so who the heck is this author? And then purpose. Is it entertaining? Is it to inform or is it to persuade? Are you persuading? Are you just giving facts? Are you warning about the weather that’s coming? OK. And as we answer those questions, that’s going to tell us, is our article reliable? OK. So what I’d like you to do, I want you to take the article that you brought today, and I’d like you to fill this in.

Renee: Especially with social media. It’s so easy to find an article online and just share it to however many people. But if people don’t take the time to notice the details, it can cause a lot of chaos.

Nikki Nies: I think we have a very polarized United States, and I think it’s very easy to find articles or news sources that will support your theories on certain things. So that news is out there. But it’s understanding the reliability of that source, before we are quick to say that as a fact. Thank you, guys. Have a good day.

Student: You too.

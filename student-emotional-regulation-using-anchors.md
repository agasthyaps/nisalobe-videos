At every age and grade level, students can become emotionally dysregulated throughout the day, distracting from class work and contributing to the overall level of tension in the room. But when encouraged to identify simple, personalized tools—or “anchors”—for grounding themselves that they can access at any time, and given regular reminders to connect with those anchors, students of all ages can practice the ability to regulate themselves in moments when they feel triggered, which leads to more emotional stability. From a simple stretch, to grabbing a peppermint, to thinking of a trusted adult, finding ways to anchor oneself emotionally can pave the path to a smoother experience in and out of class.

This social and emotional learning strategy was shared by educator Lori Desautels. To learn more, read her article for Edutopia titled “ A Daily Practice That Students Can Use for Self-Regulation .”

## Transcript

When we think about an anchor, an anchor really steadies a boat, and it keeps the boat from moving in directions that might feel dangerous. So when we anchor ourselves, we really are intentionally providing resources. Maybe a sound, a taste, a practice that actually can bring us into a state of focus, curiosity, creativity. We can move through our days and yet feel safe and connected. So the first step is identifying what our activators are. For all developmental levels, we know that we can get emotionally triggered. We have to be aware of when we start to feel a little uneasy, or sometimes our bodies will sweat or we can feel our heartbeat. We can ask, “What are some of the people or places or things, just anything that can really activate your nervous system?” So we have students write those down just so we are comfortable with identifying what those triggers are, and then we talk about how anchors can really settle us. And we begin to brainstorm together what could be an anchor for you. Maybe it is movement, taking some deep breaths, calling up an image of an adult that you trust. Maybe an in-the-moment anchor might be grabbing a peppermint, listening to some music for a minute. So these are the practices that we can really bring into the present moment and know that those are available to us. As a teacher, I want to make these accessible every day. So we create space and time for students to use these anchors. And we’re all doing this together. It becomes a part of our first 10 minutes of class. But realistically, there are times throughout the day we may become upset or there is an incident that happens. I will make that suggestion that it’s time to connect with your anchors, and I will give them the time and the space. We all have different needs and challenges at different times during the day. Our awareness of our anchors is a superpower so that we can lean into our own resources. I have the awareness to know what my nervous system needs when I’m feeling dysregulated.

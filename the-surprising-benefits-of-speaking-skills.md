When teachers find ways to promote oracy in the classroom—from oral storytelling to small group discussions and Socratic seminars—it helps students develop social and self-regulatory skills while supporting language and vocabulary acquisition. In fact, a wide body of research shows that the benefits of building speaking skills and learning how to express oneself well is a significant factor in long-term social and emotional and academic success.

## Transcript

Narrator : Unlike reading and writing, which are complex, learned behaviors, spoken language is more like an instinct, hardwired into our developing brains from infancy. In fact, research suggests that speech is one of the first tools we reach for to make sense of ourselves and the world around us. It’s how we exert self-control, practice cooperating with others, and process hard problems. Young children internalize good behavior by repeating their caretaker’s instructions out loud, says the psychologist and researcher Ethan Kross, before transitioning to a nearly continuous stream of silent inner speech as they wrestle with childish urges and dilemmas. Even informal, rambling storytelling, often seen as academically fruitless, has a crucial developmental role, according to early childhood expert Erika Christakis. Simple storytelling activities can boost reading comprehension, vocabulary, and writing abilities, and strong oral language skills predict healthier interactions with peers and teachers, and fewer behavioral problems during the first few years of school. We almost certainly undervalue oral language skills across grade levels, including among older students. A 2023 study found that introductory speech courses improved college students’ interpersonal communication skills, which in turn decreased their feelings of loneliness and bolstered their sense of belonging. Letting kids tell stories isn’t a waste of time. In early elementary, teachers can arrange students in a circle and have them share a story from their day. Alternatively, ask students to take turns leading a daily read-aloud, or break them into small groups to engage in free-flowing, imaginative storytelling. Some students will naturally be anxious about speaking in front of a group, but that doesn’t mean they should be cut off from the benefits of oracy. To ease students into it, try creating larger groups of four to six students to present something they learned while sitting at their desks. Then, work up to smaller groups of two to three kids and move the presentations to the front of the class. By middle or high school, educators can teach students explicit strategies of successful public speaking, like eye contact, intonation, and hand motions. You can show students models of successful speech as well, like famous renditions of Shakespeare monologues or popular TED Talks. Teachers of any subject can integrate oracy into class, not just ELA teachers. In math class, for example, students can work together to solve problems in small discussion groups, then present the steps they took to the entire class.

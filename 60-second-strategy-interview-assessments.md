## Transcript

Teacher: This is that quiz that you took on Monday, and some of them, I wasn’t sure if you knew what you were doing or not. And so this is your chance to explain it to me. My goal for doing interview assessments to inform my teaching and to find out what kids already know. The most important first step is to make sure you know what it is you want the kids to know. I write down what I expect a proficient student should be able to say, this, this, this and that. What works best for me is if it’s in a time when the rest of the class have something that they’re engaged in to do. So we know that it doesn’t have a common factor.

Student: Complete the square.

Teacher: Okay. It gives them more opportunities to recall information, share it in a kind of relaxed way. I hope the assessments go for five minutes or less, and what I like to take away from them is a good feel for how well the student knows that material. I don’t do them for every student. It works great for kids who know a lot more than they showed on an assessment.

Student: That’s your factor.

Teacher: Mm-hmm, that’s your total. It gives them multiple opportunities to show that they are proficient.

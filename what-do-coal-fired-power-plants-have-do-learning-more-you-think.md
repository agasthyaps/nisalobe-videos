# What Do Coal-Fired Power Plants Have to Do With Learning? More Than You Think

> A 2020 study reminds us that educational equity does not begin and end at the schoolhouse door.

## Article

When three coal-fired plants closed in the Chicago area, student absences in nearby schools dropped by 7 percent, a change largely driven by fewer emergency room visits for asthma-related problems. The stunning finding, published in a 2020 study from Duke and Penn State, underscores the role that often-overlooked environmental factors—like air quality, neighborhood crime, and noise pollution—have in keeping our children healthy and ready to learn.

## Transcript

In 1946, the National School Lunch Act formally acknowledged that learning is linked to the food we eat. Half a century later, a provocative new study suggests it’s also in the air we breathe When three coal-fired power plants closed in Chicago, the 2020 study found, absences in nearby schools dropped by 7%, a change largely driven by fewer emergency room visits for asthma-related problems. At scale, the opportunity cost is staggering. About 2.3 million children in the U.S. still attend a public elementary or middle school located within 10 kilometers of a coal-fired plant. The study builds on a body of recent research that ties a readiness to learn to often-overlooked environmental factors like neighborhood crime, noise pollution, and childhood trauma, making a forceful argument that we will not have educational equity until we confront inequality not only in our schools, but in our cities, our neighborhoods and ultimately in our own backyards.

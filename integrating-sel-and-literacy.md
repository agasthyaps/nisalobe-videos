Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School students attend a daily 40-minute advisory meeting that combines social and emotional learning work and literacy. This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School .

## Transcript

Chad Prather: Part of our focus in terms of SEL is to become more aware of our emotions and reactions. So Rashad is the character who gets– Arshon: Abused by the police officer Chad Prather: Do you see these things happening?

Student: I’ve seen it happen to others.

Voiceover: Because our kids participate in daily advisory they feel more connected to our school community, they feel like they know themselves and others around them better, and we have huge accomplishments in our kids’ learning outcomes.

Chad Prather: We’re gonna begin just with two minutes of mindfulness Dr.

Sonia Stewart: The nest is our daily advisory.

Chad Prather: Think about inhaling and exhaling.

Allison Tilley: We’re really reflecting on what we are proud of about ourselves.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: We’re really focused on two things. One is literacy.

Chad Prather: Right after this part right here.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: And the other one is social emotional learning.

Student: I know, I did I was like super excited.

Allison Tilley: I really want you to think on who you are, what you represent, things that you’re going through. At Pearl-Cohn we want to increase a discussion based classroom. A class is never going to look discussion based if the kids aren’t comfortable talking in front of each other because they’re worried they’ll be made fun of or they’re worried that they’ll have the wrong answer. So we build family mindset, getting to know each other, talking through goals, talking through setbacks. The good things of life, the hardships of life. Y’all just put it in your own words that’s like the best part.

Student: How I’m supposed to explain something I don’t know how to do?

Shayne: We can talk about anything we want, tell our teacher just everything. You get to know other students better and create a bond with each other. I’m proud to be a strong woman, I’m proud of being a volleyball player and I am proud of Miss Tilley and her hard work.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: And then the second part of the nest is spent reading a novel together.

Chad Prather: We are going to dig back into this book Dr.

Sonia Stewart: Really great novels lead to great conversations and they perfectly align with social emotional learning. I believe literacy is a civil rights issue in this country. We consider our citizens literate at ninth grade or higher and the vast majority of my kids are below that and that means they’re not engaging our society, our democracy in a way that is empowering and participatory. So if there is one thing we put a lot of energy around it is trying to help our kids become readers.

Chad Prather: We are reading a book called All-American Boys.

Student: I didn’t want to hear my father preach about how young black people lack pride and integrity and making us easy targets.

Chad Prather: We wanna to broaden kids’ capacity to enjoy reading by having deep conversations about the subjects and themes the kids live out.

Student: The first story was about a kid accused of stealing from a store on the west side.

Chad Prather: So on the middle of page a hundred you’ve got this cop who represents this abusive authority. You had a reaction to that.

Arshon: People abuse their authority when they get it.

Chad Prather: Conversation today was about mistrust between authority and community. When our kids read that there’s a guttural reaction that takes place.

Arshon: Like, I just got so mad. This boy, he got beat up by a police officer. When I heard that I instantly, it just draw me into it because that’s something I see, I go through everyday.

Student: Like a lot of this stuff has actually happened.

Arshon: There’s a lot of police brutality going on. Sometimes it kind of releases some rage.

Student: That still goes on, I mean… Dr.

Sonia Stewart: So it’s access to text and giving them the ability to face each other, look each other in the eye and have conversations around significant topics.

Student: I want to say altercation, but then– Chad Prather: The nest lays the ground for academic learning. It holds kids to higher standards and to higher expectations. It’s a time to build community and to make certain that each kid has at least one individual in the building that invests personally in his or her best.

Arshon: Our nest is a family.

Chad Prather: Somos familia.

Arshon: I feel like I can talk about anything I need to here.

Chad Prather: We’re sitting silently, we’ll start by focusing– Dr.

Sonia Stewart: Looking at the data, they’ve grown in learning and have become people that are increasingly more aware of who they are and care for others. All of that is directly linked to social emotional learning and the work that happens in the nest.

Allison Tilley: You guys have changed and grown up so much this year and I’m so lucky to know you.

# There’s a Cell Phone in Your Student’s Head

> A 2017 study found that cell phones that were turned off and stashed away silently reasserted themselves—distracting working students anyway.

## Article

Many studies have investigated the so-called “downstream” effect of cell phone presence on learning. Students who split their attention between a learning task and texting on their cell phones or accessing Facebook , for example, perform poorly when compared to students who are not dividing their attention. But recent research from the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research suggests that cell phones might have a negative “upstream” impact on learning, too.

The authors propose that the mere presence of a cell phone, even when it is silenced and stored out of sight, might be undermining our ability to focus. “The presence of one’s smartphone enables on-demand access to information, entertainment… and more,” the study concludes. “However, our research suggests that these benefits—and the dependence they engender—may come at a cognitive cost.” A bevy of other studies, meanwhile, clearly indicate that environments or activities that divide our attention can hurt us when taking tests and especially when encoding new learning.

Taken together, there’s increasing evidence that the presence and usage of cell phone in the classroom—while not necessarily detrimental in all contexts—should be carefully monitored, intentionally structured, and even restricted in some cases.

## Transcript

Narrator: In 2017, researchers looked at the effect of cell phone presence on students. Students were asked to complete math problems with their cellphones placed on their desks, stashed in nearby bags or clothing, or left behind in separate rooms. They turned off ring tones, buzzing, pings, the works. In fact, students didn’t interact with or hear their phones at all, but it didn’t matter. The phone continued to exert a powerful influence, occupying the student’s mental space even as they ignored it. Students performed worse when the phone was nearby on the desk, and no, it didn’t matter if they turned it facedown. They didn’t fare much better when the phone was hidden in a bag or a pocket. Physical separation from the phone produced the best outcomes. So, what’s the new insight here/ IT looks like the mere presence of our phones might be triggering a neural system called automatic attention That’s a brain system that unconsciously monitors the environment for signs of crucial importance. It screens out irrelevant information but snaps us to attention when someone calls our name, for example, an infant cry, or a police siren wails. In other words, our phones, with their constant pings and buzzes may be tripping some of our deepest mission-critical wiring, creating a persistent sense of urgency even when the phone is completely off or stored away, and draining away precious cognitive resources that could be used for tasks like studying. What can be done about all this? The researchers concluded that intuitive fixes like placing the phone face down or turning it off were futile. And that’s a direct quote. Actual physical separation from the phone was the only effective solution. That’s true when your students are taking tests, of course, but the research says that physical separation is even more crucial when they’re initially trying to learn something.

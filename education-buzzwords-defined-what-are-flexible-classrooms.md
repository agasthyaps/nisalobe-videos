## Transcript

Teacher: If you guys want to work independently, what is going to be the best place?

Pam Moran: We realized if we were trying to have kids communicate, engage in collaborative work, focus on critical thinking, the dominant teaching model where everybody is sitting at a desk, facing the wall, teacher up front, was not going to work. Penelope Pak-McMillan: Flexible space gives them the opportunity to learn in different ways. You may see students in a circle and having a dialogue, or you might see a teacher floating around and giving one-on-one support to kids.

Jess Scherer: When a teacher doesn’t have to be in the front of the room, they can make choices with their curriculum. Students don’t all have to be learning the exact same thing at the same time.

Teacher: If you’re going to work independently to catch up, you’ll actually turn the tables toward that wall. Those who want the mini-lesson are going to come to this table.

Teacher: Is everybody ready?

Student: You can write that down. Compare and contrast.

Pam Moran: So when we give our kids choices in that environment that provides them with the opportunity to make decisions about the things that they really need to be successful in school.

Teacher: You’re just using the facts.

Student: Yeah.

Teacher: Love it.

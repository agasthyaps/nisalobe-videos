## Article

Teacher Henry Seton incorporates a participation grade in his daily rapid review. By noting student responses against the class roster—putting a 1 by the student’s name if they answer correctly and a 0 if they do not—he’s able to track and balance participation. If a student misses a question, he circles back to them later in the activity (or on the following day) so they can earn the point back.

Bonus points are given when a student “rescues” a classmate by stepping up to answer when they fumble. Seton averages each student’s score for a weekly participation grade, so even if a student has a bad day, they can still get a strong score for the week. While a participation grade is not essential for this strategy, it can be a helpful and low-stakes form of accountability and assessment.

The rapid review strategy was inspired by Doug Lemov’s pepper retrieval practice from his book Teach Like a Champion .

Teacher: And then I’ll ask them to stand up.

Teacher: All right, gentlemen, it is time for rapid— Class: Review!

Teacher: What is one idea from John Locke that directly influenced our nation? Charlie?

Charlie: He believes in a three-part government.

Teacher: If a student gets stuck, I’ll say, “Rescue”—students can raise their hand to help out the other classmate.

Student: An example would be— Teacher: Rapid review starts class with energy and excitement. Students feel like the content is sticking. They’re getting a lot of cold-call questions, but it’s in a safe, supportive atmosphere and helps students feel confident with the material.

## Article

When high school math teacher Jennifer Feehan got home one day, she turned to her husband proudly and said, “I had kids running to do math problems today. Like, running .” Her secret? A game called 100 Squares Challenge, which she uses as a tool for review in her AP precalculus class at Fauquier High School , in Warrenton, Virginia.

To prepare, she sources dozens of math problems from worksheets and AP classroom questions. She cuts up the worksheets so that each piece of paper includes just one problem, and she makes an answer key for herself. In class, Feehan lays all of the problems face-down and projects a 100-square grid on her whiteboard.

She asks students to form teams of two. When she says, “Go!” students grab a math problem and then work with their partner to solve it as quickly as possible. Once they have an answer, one of the partners approaches Feehan to check their answer.

If the answer is incorrect, the pair has a second chance to rework the problem. If they get it right, they sign their initials in a numbered square of their choice. The goal is to claim as many squares as possible to increase the odds of winning the game.

Students move in every direction—racing to Feehan, racing to the board, and racing to get a new problem. Nestor, a 10th-grade student, said, “It was chaotic, but I think it was chaotic in a good way.” Students continue adding their initials to the grid until every square is full. At that point, students who get a problem right still need to add their initials to a square—but to do so, they have to erase the initials of one of their classmates.

Nestor recalls, “I was having a sort of rivalry with one of my other classmates where I would erase his square and he would erase mine. That was certainly very fun.” At the end of the set time—usually 20 minutes—Feehan uses a calculator to generate a random number between 1 and 100. The winner is the team that has their initials on that square.

The result elicits cheers and groans. Both the students and Feehan benefit from this activity. The students receive immediate feedback on whether they’ve solved a problem correctly.

For Feehan, patterns emerge: If multiple groups of students get the same problem wrong, she knows she’ll need to review that concept. The high-energy nature of the game means that students gain practice completing problems under pressure. “It gives you the AP problems in a way that’s less stressful than the test,” Nestor notes.

Some students may complete five problems, while others may complete a dozen. Because the winner is determined by luck, it’s worthwhile for all students to try their best. In the end, Feehan notes, “it’s kids having fun doing math.

And that’s the goal.”

## Transcript

Jennifer Feehan: Yes, give yourself a square. Put your name up there.

Jennifer Feehan: It’s a lot of motion, it’s a lot of talking, it’s a lot of paper, it’s a lot of whiteboards and markers and erasers and just things going everywhere.

Jennifer Feehan: Oh no! Math problems are flying!

Jennifer Feehan: It’s kids having fun doing math and that’s the goal.

Jennifer Feehan: Go, that’s 16, yes, yes.

Jennifer Feehan: My mission is for all of my students to feel welcome and enjoy what they’re doing. The kids that I’m lucky enough to have really want to push themselves in math. A hundred squares challenge, I usually will do at the end of a block or as review, so the day before a test. I project a basic hundred-square board. I pull questions from worksheets that I would have done, AP classroom questions, just any resource that I can find and I can cut up into pieces. I lay them all out on a table, face down. I tell them to get into groups of two.

Jennifer Feehan: CJ, who you working with? You win, Hannah, ding, ding, ding.

Nestor: I think it’s really beneficial if you have someone to talk to, especially with AP Precalculus.

Jennifer Feehan: You get to take one problem at a time. Go!

Nestor: When she said go, we would all run up and get one of our questions, and we’d race back to our tables as fast as we could and do the problems. We scramble up to her and try not to elbow each other out of the way, and she’ll look at her answer key and be like, Yes or No. Is this one C?

Jennifer Feehan: Yes.

Nestor: OK.

Jennifer Feehan: If they have it right, they get to put their name on the board.

Student: Go, Mary! Go, go, go!

Jennifer Feehan: It allows me as the teacher, when they’re bringing me problems, to see the ones that they’re getting right and the ones they’re getting wrong right away. So when I say no, I’m in my mind going, that’s problem 13. And then if I see problem 13 four or five times, I know that’s something that I need to hit harder with them.

Jennifer Feehan: No.

Jennifer Feehan: So it’s feedback for them if they’re getting it right or getting it wrong, but it’s also feedback for me because it’s like, where’s the misconception?

Nestor: I think it’s a really good gauge for Ms. Feehan to see what she needs to teach a bit more.

Jennifer Feehan: Yes. Yes. Yes.

Nestor: Eventually, the squares will fill up, and then you get to start erasing other people’s squares, which is when I think it gets very interesting.

Jennifer Feehan: Once all 100 squares are taken, the kids still have to put their name on the board, but the only way to do it is to take someone else’s name off.

Graham: In other classes, we really don’t do this sort of thing, we just do our assignments.

Nestor: It’s a lot more high energy, a lot more fun. I certainly got a lot of steps in going to and from my table. I think it was a good review of the midterm and a helpful preview of the AP test because it gives you the AP problems in a way that’s less stressful than the test.

Jennifer Feehan: It also benefits my kids that take things a little bit slower because they know, hey, if I only do five problems and this person is doing 10, it’s OK because a winner is based on pure luck.

Student: OK, A. 85A.

Jennifer Feehan: But it isn’t going to stop a kid from doing 100 problems. Let’s see. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

Graham: The activity concluded by Ms. Feehan picking a random number.

Jennifer Feehan: After 15, 20 minutes, I will take a number generator on my calculator and have a random integer from 1 to 100.

Student: 96.

Graham: Oh, my God.

Jennifer Feehan: You won again.

Jennifer Feehan: Whoever wins, they’re the grand champions, and they think that’s the best. I don’t ever see my kids any more engaged than when they’re in competition with each other. I thrive on the chaos and the competitiveness of these kids.

Jennifer Feehan: Good job, guys.

## Article

At Gilles-Sweet Elementary in Fairview Park, Ohio, intervention specialist Dana Reuter uses social stories to help students gain the confidence they need to navigate real-life situations. These short, personalized narratives combine visuals, age-appropriate language, and sometimes even recordings of a student’s own voice to outline both expected and unexpected behaviors. By presenting information in a clear, structured way, social stories give students tools they can rely on in the moment.

Today, Reuter is working one-on-one with a student who has experienced some challenges during recess. Together, they create a digital book that walks through what to expect on the playground. Reuter involves the student in every step of the process: They brainstorm simple sentences, select relatable photos for each page, and record his voice reading the story aloud.

By actively participating, the student develops a personal connection to the story—something Reuter has found essential for success. “We’ve noticed a huge increase in the expected behaviors and a decrease in the unexpected behaviors because he’s reciting it in his head—because he helped me develop it,” she says. Because each story is tailored to a student’s needs, it becomes a meaningful, practical tool.

Before recess, for example, this student reads his social story as a quick reminder of expectations. That short review helps him feel more confident and ready to interact with peers in positive ways. Reuter emphasizes that while social stories are often individualized, all students can benefit from them.

At the beginning of the year, social stories can be used to help introduce the whole class to a new routine, or set expectations for a particular activity or event. They empower students by breaking down experiences into understandable and manageable steps, and help build the confidence, self-regulation, and social skills that students will carry with them far beyond the classroom. The strategy of social stories was developed in 1990 by educator Carol Gray for students with autism spectrum disorders.

Social stories have since found broader use in all kinds of classroom situations with all kinds of learners. For more resources on how young learners can benefit, read Amber Unger’s article for Edutopia, “ Using Social Stories to Teach Procedures and Routines in Preschool .”

## Transcript

Student: When I am at recess, I get to play and have fun with my friends.

Dana Reuter: Because we use social stories, our students are successful in different situations. All students can actually benefit from social stories. It helps them know what to expect in situations by outlining expected behaviors as well as talking about those unexpected behaviors that they might have.

Dana Reuter: But is this showing safe hands or unsafe hands?

Dana Reuter: A social story is an effective tool that we use to help students learn how to act in social situations by using visuals and age-appropriate language for them to be able to understand.

Dana Reuter: When you have safe hands, everyone gets to have fun on the playground.

Dana Reuter: Would you like another picture of our playground? Or do you want something different?

Student: That.

Dana Reuter: Oh, you want that one?

Dana Reuter: I like to include my students, and so they have like a personal stake in creating them.

Dana Reuter: What are some things that you can play on the playground?

Dana Reuter: For this particular student, we’ve been talking about different scenarios, and what to expect, and unexpected behaviors on there. So we sat yesterday together and created the social storybook for him. Student (recorded audio): When I do this, everyone has fun on the playground!

Dana Reuter: So we come up with simple sentences that he can help with, and we put them on each page. And then he goes back and we find pictures that he can use that are relatable to that sentence.

Dana Reuter: Do you want a picture of you with your safe hands, or do you want me to find one?

Student: The picture of me.

Dana Reuter: You OK? Good job.

Dana Reuter: Then we overlay it with his voice.

Student: Safe hands help keep me and others safe.

Dana Reuter: I used it before he went out to recess. It’s that quick, fresh reminder of what we’re expecting when he goes out there… Student (recorded audio): I need to have safe hands when I am playing with my friends.

Dana Reuter: …and helps set him up for success when he’s outside.

Dana Reuter: We’ve noticed a huge increase in the expected behaviors and a decrease in the unexpected behaviors, because he’s reciting it in his head, because he helped me develop it.

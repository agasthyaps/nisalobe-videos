As a small public tuition-free charter school in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, The Greene School has always emphasized themes of interdependence—in their local ecosystems and in their classrooms. In addition to their location—a 74-acre woodland setting—one of the features that make this school so unique is a number of outdoor education elements sprinkled throughout campus, along with the way the faculty utilizes them to help students build the mindsets they need for learning. A climbing tower stands near the pond, and throughout the year, teachers use the ropes course attached to the tower in addition to various team-building activities to help students fully appreciate what they are capable of doing and learn how they can truly support each other.

“There’s so much around group dynamics and group process with a ropes course,” says Principal Alex Edelmann. “It just offers so many powerful examples and metaphors for how we function as a group.” Educators at The Greene School hold a fundamental belief that outdoor education can help students build resilience and self-reliance—and can even lead to transformational moments. “We’ve seen students who struggle in the classroom, who are regularly struggling with behavior, who are wandering in the hallways,” says Edelmann.

“But they get out there where they’re tackling an initiative with a group of students, and they show up completely differently. There’s this totally different sense of possibility that they have for themselves.” With time and practice, those tangible experiences of challenge and triumph translate into relationships and skills that support their academic pursuits in the classroom. As a senior at The Greene School, Roman has experienced that connection between outdoor education and valuable mindsets for learning firsthand.

“I think it’s taught me to have more resilience and more collaboration and cooperation with other people because you need all of that when you’re out hiking in the woods, especially when, like me, you’ve never hiked in the woods before coming here. So a lot of the skills that you learn when you’re outside working with other people also come into classwork.” To learn more about this innovative school, visit the Greene School page on Edutopia .

## Transcript

Andrea Brayman: The first task is to use the holds and create 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, OK? So can I get maybe three volunteers?

Alex Edelmann: The climbing tower is part of our outdoor education program. Our wellness teacher is actually a trained facilitator.

Andrea Brayman: So this is my [inaudible 00:00:19] team, and we are in this together.

Alex Edelmann: I think you can go to a lot of places now, and you can see rope courses, and they’re used for recreation. That’s not the point of our ropes course, and that’s not the point of our outdoor education program. There’s so much around group dynamics and group process, and a ropes course just offers so many powerful examples and metaphors for how we function as a group.

Student: You’re going to have to make a big step.

Andrea Brayman: Put your left foot a little bit higher. There you go.

Alex Edelmann: Students can climb that tower a hundred times, but with each training and with each experience, they’re learning so much more about who they are as a community member and what it really means to truly support one another.

Student: I feel like Spider-Man.

Student: Yeah, she did that.

Alex Edelmann: That tower is where we can talk about the concept of self-reliance, right? There’s so much more in us than we realize, are willing to own, are willing to accept, are willing to step into, and I think that outdoor ed kind of pushes you right into this, sometimes a place of discomfort that allows you to see yourself differently and potentially have like a transformational moment.

Andrea Brayman: Do you trust us? Can you lift your knees up so they’re not caught… Your feet… There you go.

Alex Edelmann: We’ve seen students who struggle in the classroom, who are regularly struggling with behavior, who are wandering in the hallways, but they get out there where they’re tackling an initiative with a group of students, and they show up completely differently. There’s this totally different sense of possibility that they have for themselves and that they can see in themselves.

Andrea Brayman: There’s a progression. So the idea is that as students become more comfortable, they build relationships, that they will feel like they can participate in risk-taking activities that are positive, that are going to help them grow as a human being. Nice job, Riley. Good job.

Alex Edelmann: Allowing kids time to practice and to play and to explore how they’re showing up, and how their showing up is impacting the group’s progress within that initiative and within that task, is really powerful. Sometimes when you’re in the classroom, it’s too abstract for them to see that, but they can see it very, very clearly when they’re out on a ropes course, and they can see very, very clearly that either their positive contribution or the absence thereof is impacting the group’s ability to reach their goal. That also allows faculty to use some of those really specific examples with students around what does it mean to be part of a community of learners, and what does it mean when we say everyone in this classroom matters and we need all voices and everybody’s participation, and how you show up is going to impact our experience. That outdoor education program sort of naturally is lending itself to that classroom experience.

Andrea Brayman: Good job, Hunter. How do you feel?

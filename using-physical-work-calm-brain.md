## Article

This video is part of our series on rapid resets , tools for de-escalation that can help teachers and students build resilience, calm their nervous systems, and bring their thinking brains back online. Special thanks to Resources for Resilience , an organization in Asheville, North Carolina, that trains educators in how to use these tools for themselves and with their students.

## Transcript

Leigh: Heavy work is a great way to help students get back into their resilient zone, because it gets all their muscles involved.

Leigh: Having them carry something heavy to another classroom really works, and you don’t have to tell them why. Sometimes it’s better off if I just say, “Hey, I’ve got this big crate of materials. Could you take this down to Mrs. Teague right now?” Oh yeah, because they want to be a helper. It’s really good to get a teacher partner that knows that your kids may come into a classroom carrying some bizarre item. And you just say, “Oh, who’s this from?” “Ms. Yelton, Ms. Yelton told me to bring it to you.” “Oh, that is wonderful. Thank you, I needed it so much.” Leigh: I have sent some bizarre stuff. I sent some blocks. I have sent a potted plant, just whatever I could find at the time that worked. And when they come back, they seem to be fine and then we can say, “Are you all right? What’s going on?”

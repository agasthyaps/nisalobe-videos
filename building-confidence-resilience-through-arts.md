How can schools create a healing environment in their classrooms—with a trauma-informed lens? Students in the small town of Glen Ellen, like many in California, were affected first by wildfires and then by the social isolation of the pandemic. Teachers needed a way to build students’ resilience and self-regulation skills back up.

Their solution? Partnering with—and getting training from—local arts organizations, including Kimzin Creative and Sonoma Community Center , to help students learn how to express themselves and collaborate with each other again. Two years in, Dunbar Elementary School relies on their trauma-informed arts program to boost students’ confidence and release their anxieties.

The school brings in local artists to teach lessons that emphasize creativity and self-expression over technique—giving students a brain break and providing a place where they can feel a sense of calm. The program is supported with funds raised by local nonprofit Sonoma Valley Education Foundation . Teachers say that since the program began, classroom engagement has soared.

## Transcript

Maria Ptucha: What color are you gonna do for the hair?

Boy: I just want my hair blue.

Maria Ptucha: Oh, blue hair?

Boy: Yeah. Karen O’Hara: I think students that have gone through any trauma really benefit from the arts. Working with your hands I think helps calm the students. They have control to make whatever they want. So I’m seeing a lot more engagement. They’re connecting with what they’re learning.

Maria Ptucha: I really like all the details you’re adding. You’re really focused. Karen O’Hara: Dunbar Elementary School sits in a beautiful location in northern Sonoma Valley. We are a very small country school, and our demographics are over 75 percent English language learners. A lot of these children were affected by the fires of 2017, and we brought in arts to help them. So DunbARTS program, it brings in art experts that come in and teach the kids clay and drawing practices, painting techniques, or even 3D art.

Kelly Autumn: You know what we’re focusing on today?

Students: What?

Kelly Autumn: Color.

Kelly Autumn: Today’s lesson was about decorating clay masks that the kids built. We were really trying to emphasize sort of a Picassoesque approach where an eye can be many different shapes, a nose can be many different shapes, and so to think outside the box.

Kelly Autumn: What did they make the mouth out of?

Boy: Triangle.

Kelly Autumn: A triangle. That’s right. We’re encouraging a lot of freedom and play and not so heavy on technique.

Kelly Autumn: You’re going to color directly on the clay. Isn’t that cool?

Kelly Autumn: Kids, especially in this age group, they’re taught to stay within the lines. When you’re encouraging them to just be free with their color and expression, I think that they were able to really explore and just be themselves.

Maria Ptucha: What were you asking, Ma’lyah? Ma’lyah: Can I make it as a…?

Maria Ptucha: Yeah, you can make it as whatever you want.

Maria Ptucha: There’s not as much fear around the creative process as there might be with a math assignment or with reading or writing. It gives them a chance to be really confident and to be a skilled artist. Ma’lyah: I feel happy when I’m doing art. It just makes me feel proud.

Girl: I’m doing three different kinds of, like, dimensions. Like there’s a beach at night, and then in this one I’m going to do the sun.

Kelly Autumn: This is a wash. Is it giving it darkness or lightness?

Students: Darkness.

Kelly Autumn: Darkness, that’s right.

Kelly Autumn: Art is not just learning skills. You’re also being recognized for the work that you make that builds their self-esteem. It also helps with some empathy because kids will give each other compliments: “Wow, I really like how you drew those ears. Wow, I really like how you did that.” Maria Ptucha: You got it? You got it! That’s great.

Maria Ptucha: Art gives everybody a mental break. It’s a very relaxing experience.

Maria Ptucha: You’re in the calm green space, as my kids would call it. Like I’m feeling green right now because I’m ready to learn.

Kelly Autumn: Yes, please. Thank you for helping with cleanup. Do you want me to cut that out for you, too? Karen O’Hara: Our students get to express themselves in ways that they probably didn’t know or that are deep down inside. They get to release any stresses that they might have. Any child that’s gone through trauma needs to release their feelings, and they can do that through the arts.

Kelly Autumn: Great work, everyone.

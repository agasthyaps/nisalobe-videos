## Article

Cathleen Beachboard, an English language arts teacher at Fauquier High School in Warrenton, Virginia, doesn’t shy away from debate in her classroom. In fact, she finds it to be an engaging review activity aimed at cultivating deeper understanding with her students. At the end of a unit of study, she asks each student to reflect with the following prompt: What is the unit’s most important piece of information?

They start with a solo writing exercise, then take their idea and have mini-debates with their classmates, trying to persuade others to change their opinion and adopt their idea. “You get to learn persuasive argumentation,” Beachboard says, “and it values everybody’s voice in the conversation.” Eventually, students team up more and more, coalescing around a central idea and building more arguments along the way. “They’re responding with… evidentiary support for each one of their claims,” Beachboard says, an important lesson “that you don’t just state an opinion without a fact.” Once larger groups form, spokespeople from each group make their case, and students are encouraged to change their minds.

“That’s something that I also want to teach kids,” Beachboard notes. “As you grow and you learn new things, you become different. You’re not the same person you were when you were in kindergarten or first grade.

You grow and you evolve. And so it’s OK to change your opinion.” Though there is never one right answer, this engaging review activity always leads to energetic discussion and revelations. The winning team is the one that has the most students at the end (or, in the event of a tie, the team that persuades the teacher to join their side).

But the best outcome? The process of formulating an argument—and then strengthening it through peer collaboration—cultivates a deeper understanding, develops students’ critical thinking skills, and helps them remember key lessons. To try this activity (and adapt it for any subject), download the Comprehension Clash handout that Beachboard uses to guide her students through the process.

## Transcript

Student: People only ever seek revenge for the goal of acquiring power.

Student: The reason why they lost the war is because they were drowned by the thought of power.

Cathleen Beachboard: I’ve seen over and over again with the Comprehension Clash, the kids are more likely to remember the content as a whole after they’ve done this because they’re reflecting, they’re revising, they’re listening. They’re creating. What is it that we did, and why does it matter?

Cathleen Beachboard: Ready, set, go.

Cathleen Beachboard: Fauquier High School is a very special place because of the freedom that the staff is given to innovate for the curriculum to make sure that it truly connects with kids. We look at how we can provide voice and choice in our lessons to truly get kids excited about learning.

Cathleen Beachboard: So the big question that I want you to reflect on right now for Julius Caesar is what is our unit’s most important piece of information or knowledge?

Cathleen Beachboard: Comprehension Clash is an activity that teaches them to listen to each other, work together, and it makes them prioritize. What was important to me? How did it connect with me as a learner?

Cathleen Beachboard: So the first step is to give students time to reflect on their why. Why is this information important to me? And what was the most important thing? Using my own background, my own knowledge, my own resources?

Cathleen Beachboard: Now, I want you to look and find someone who does not have the same response as you, and I want you to have a mini debate with them.

Student: You want to know why I chose manipulation? You know how yours is trust, right, and mistrust? Sometimes you can manipulate the other person to gain their trust.

Layla: We discussed it with somebody that had a different opinion to feel out what they thought and to compare arguments to see which one was better.

Student: I do like your opinion.

Layla: OK. Do you want to switch?

Student: OK, I’ll switch over.

Cathleen Beachboard: The next step is group formation. As soon as they have a set number, they’re allowed to start devising why is their opinion the most important.

Layla: We had a couple minutes to discuss how we would convince the other groups. They’d bring up points either from Julius Caesar itself or real-world examples.

Student: I want to bring up the biggest point in the story where Brutus and Cassius killed themselves because of irrational thinking.

Xavier: It’s talking to other people about how we think. We are trying to use more detailed words and convince people to come over to our side.

Cathleen Beachboard: I want you to hold up the sheet of paper summarizing what your group believes in. We have revenge, team leadership, irrational thinking is bad, power. Explain why they should join your group.

Xavier: You can manipulate the people to gain the power and get leadership.

Cathleen Beachboard: Ooh. After every group is presented, they are given time where they can change their mind. The group with the largest amount at the end wins. So you can move, you can merge. I’m going to give you one minute to decide where you want to be.

Layla: The class had 20 people and it was an even split. And so Ms. Beachboard ended up having us feed our arguments to her.

Cathleen Beachboard: After listening to both sides, I am going to have to walk over to this group. All right.

Layla: Having different points of view being presented to you really helps with understanding.

Cathleen Beachboard: My mission as a teacher ultimately is to make sure that every child realizes that their opinions and ideas are valuable. So many times in education, we have an answer key. There is no answer key to this. And so this is teaching kids that sometimes when we work together, we can find answers.

Cathleen Beachboard: All right, good job guys. Here, pass them in.

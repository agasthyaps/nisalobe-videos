# Exploring Writing, Social Studies, and Math in a Map Challenge

> Encouraging students to bring their creativity and imagination to challenging content makes it more accessible—and helps them learn it more deeply.

## Article

Each fifth grader in Andrea Ketcham’s class in Eminence, Kentucky, has been charged with creating a world and asking someone else to navigate it. In this interdisciplinary project, students use a range of skills—from spatial awareness and mapmaking to communication skills and coding. To touch on English language arts standards, students use descriptive language to write about their imaginary land.

Next, to align with social studies standards, they’re tasked with drawing a map depicting it, complete with key features like grid points and a compass rose. When their maps are complete, the students come up with questions that challenge a classmate to identify characteristics of their land and program a Sphero BOLT robot to follow directions and get to a specific destination. By the end, students have mastered content from multiple subject areas—and stayed engaged and excited through the whole process.

## Transcript

Andrea Ketcham : Because my kids use their imagination, they love school. They love to learn, and I feel like they’re more successful in their learning. It makes it easier to teach challenging content, because students don’t feel like they are struggling with it. They’re more engaged in that challenging content. You all are going to be continuing to work on your world’s maps. Andrea Ketcham : I was really focused on the social studies standard, that students can use a variety of maps to determine relationships between different locations, or use the map to determine other information. I could have taught it by just handing them a map of the world, and being like, locate point A on it and then have to find the longitude and latitude points of that point A. I thought maybe if they created their own map, they would be more engaged with their own world. Evangeline : East, north, all the way up here. Evangeline : I like making things up, because you can sort of do whatever you want with it. You can make unicorn islands. You can make deserts, mountains, jungles, and I really think that that’s a good way to let your creativity flow. Andrea Ketcham : Cool, so where would your uncharted island be on your map? Student : Probably look around here, but of course it’s uncharted. Andrea Ketcham : And then they wrote a story about their own world. Then from this story, they had to create their own map of their world, where they included all the important features of a map—the compass rose, a key, a scale, all of their continent, and countries, and physical features, and bodies of water. Nora : We used our imagination to make different countries, and different shapes for your countries, and the names, and all that. Andrea Ketcham : And then from there, they created challenge questions for other students to answer. What we’re going to do now is we’re going to head to the Ed Hub. Today, we went into the Ed Hub, which is like our communal space in the school, and students set up their maps. Half the class then answered those challenge questions that students had created. Student : Where is Tellerman Ocean located? Sebastian : It’s like what continent is like 50 degrees west and 70 degrees east. So this project can help you know your directions and stuff. Andrea Ketcham : It’s going to be 130— Student : 130 east and 30 north. Student : Yeah, that one was a little much. Andrea Ketcham : That one is a little tricky. For some of the questions, the students were using the SpheroBOLTs, and they had to use the iPads to program the SpheroBOLTs to locate points on the map, or go from one place to another to follow a set of directions. I was able to touch upon social studies, and then ELA with descriptive language. Math, because the coordinate points are very similar to coordinate graphing, and then we also talked about climates, which is a science standard for fifth grade. I saw lots of creativity. A lot of kids that struggle or don’t participate a lot, this really helped them come out and participate and be excited about learning. Student : Where’s 30 west?

Social-Emotional Learning: A Schoolwide Approach (Transcript) Susan: What would it be like if we walked around and we had mindful eyes?

Student: We’d notice like almost everything around us, and we’d be aware of our surroundings.

Susan: Absolutely. Think about that when you– Joan: What makes Symonds successful is the integration of social and academic learning.

Richard: By the time they get to fifth grade, they’re actually pretty good at being able to talk about issues and things that are happening in their lives.

Susan: Social Emotional Learning is an essential piece of the child’s ability to function in a school setting. They’re being asked to integrate their conversations in ways that are not natural to them. They’re asked to sit more closely to someone than they might choose to. They need to function in a social setting in order to learn their academics. The children need to see it and hear it in many, many different ways.

Joan: Because it is so integrated, you almost can’t pull it apart. It’s all about the little pieces.

Teacher: Check for whole-body listening. Eyes, ears, heart– showing me that you’re caring about me. Brain, make sure you’re thinking about my words. Body is still.

All: [singing] “Body, body, body, body. Whole-body listening with my body. Now’s not the time for practicing karate.” Richard: We spent a lot of time and effort trying to create a warm and supportive environment, so kids graduate from here with confidence. But before you can understand yourself and your feelings, you have to be able to identify what they are.

Teacher: We’re going to read a scenario or a trigger about something that might happen. Your job is to move your body near a mat of that zone.

Joan: Let’s say you woke up feeling sick.

Teacher: I want you to move like you are feeling sick. How would you feel? What zone would be expected if you’re sick.

Ivy: I picked blue because you’re tired, and you’re sad, because you might have had a playdate that day or something.

Teacher: Disappointed that you’re feeling sick. What would be the red zone feeling that you might feel?

Student: Mad.

Teacher: You might be mad that you’re missing something. That would definitely be a red zone feeling.

Joan: We want kids to understand, you know, what their feeling state is. If it’s an uncomfortable feeling state, “What tools do I have so I can bring myself back into the green zone?” Richard: We spent a lot of time talking with kids about what strategies they should apply in what circumstances.

Susan: Our shoulders are down, our heads are tall, like they’re poking through the clouds. We’re strong like a mountain. You can use your anchor spot to help you with your mindful breathing. If your thoughts go away to the past, or to the future, remember judging, planning, just notice it. Breathing in, breathing out. Okay, here we go.

Susan: Mindfulness is teaching people to be in the present. And to be open to what’s happening right now.

Gretchen: She’s had a really positive effect on the class. They’ve had a chance to realize, “Oh, when I’m really feeling stressed out, I can go, “Stop,” take some breaths. Sort of be in a better place, or be more ready to handle what’s happening in my day.

Susan: Why are we doing this?

Student: Stay in the present and concentrate.

Student: Helps to be calm.

Justin: If I can’t figure out a problem in math or something, it helps me not get stressed out as much.

Susan: We teach the social skill, we model the social skills, but the more opportunities they have to do things outside of the structured classroom, the better.

Susan: Lunch Groups are just a way to support kids in terms of their Social Emotional Learning by getting an opportunity to come together with a supportive adult, and their peers, and practice friendship skills and problem-solving skills.

Susan: What’s your happiest thing today.

Student: That I got to go ice-skating over vacation.

Student: Aaliyah,, what is your happy thing?

Aaliyah: I went to Massachusetts to go see my dad for five days.

Aaliyah: It actually feels good to have four people so you’re not really nervous about what you say.

Susan: When you get compliments, how do you feel?

Aaliyah: I feel really proud, because I’m… Susan: We’re really asking them who they are, and what matters to them, and what’s going well for them, and what’s not going well for them. And encouraging each other to help each other out.

Aaliyah: It really hurts sometimes, and it actually feels good when I let it out, because they actually help me about my problems.

Ivy: Sometimes when you let out your feelings, you don’t really like worry about it so much.

Ivy: I feel mad because I’m doing the work that I’m supposed to do, and you’re not.

Susan: Okay, and what do you want?

Ivy: I would like you to do your part.

Susan: Awesome. Assertive. Great.

Alli: One of my students was new to Symonds School this year. After she started going to group, I noticed a big difference in her behavior. She seemed more receptive to directions and learning. She really started to open up.

Richard: And we try to give kids a lot of opportunities where they can be successful, and then have them build upon those successful experiences and transfer them into the academic world. If kids can graduate from here with a degree of self-confidence, that is a gift that we can give them which will carry them throughout life.

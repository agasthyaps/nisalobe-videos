## Article

Building social and emotional learning (SEL) into elementary math lessons not only is possible but can benefit students’ emotional awareness as well as their mathematical thinking and skills. Plus, giving students meaningful opportunities to build empathy and connect their own emotions (and the feelings of those around them) with class content helps them relate to math concepts in new ways. To learn more about the graphing activity, read elementary educator Danielle Andersen’s article for Edutopia titled “ Using an SEL Tool Called the Mood Meter in Elementary Math .” To see more details about the collaborative paper airplanes, check out instructional math coach Sandy Vorensky’s piece “ Encouraging Achievement in Math While Supporting SEL .” And for more on math interviews—with older students—and to download a sample math interview worksheet, watch the Edutopia video “ A Simple Strategy to Get Students Talking About Math ,” filmed in Connell Cloyd’s classroom.

## Transcript

Narrator: In a busy elementary classroom, teaching social and emotional skills can sometimes feel like an add-on there’s not enough time for. But with some careful planning, you can find ways to integrate social and emotional learning, or SEL, right into your lessons—even in math. Here are three meaningful activities to help you seamlessly weave social and emotional strategies into your core math curriculum. Graphing your feelings, if your class uses a daily wellness check-in tool like the Zones of Regulation or the Mood Meter, you can apply that data in your graphing lessons at almost every grade level. Use a week’s worth of anonymous emotional data to build charts or bar graphs—individually or as a class. Then, have your students assess trends across the class or reflect on emotions they personally feel most or least often. The benefit of this exercise is twofold: Students learn about graphing and data trends, and they become more aware of the range of their own feelings and the feelings of those around them. Paper airplane collaboration, this activity is a fun way to connect students through building the perfect paper airplane—and they’ll be building their interpersonal skills at the same time. Model step-by-step instructions with the class, then have students create their own original airplanes. In small groups, have the students fly their planes and practice measuring and recording their partners’ distances. Providing opportunities for your students to collaborate on a project that is relatable and interest-driven can boost students’ growth—both in SEL and in mathematics. Peer-to-peer interviews, when students ask their classmates a range of questions about math, they work together to deepen their understanding of mathematical concepts—and each other. After students work on a problem on their own, pair them up and have them do interviews about their math struggles and strategies. Introduce questions about math attitudes and mindsets, like “When you read this problem, how did it make you feel?” This exercise not only allows students to learn from their peers; it also builds empathy and belonging, fostering a supportive learning community. Incorporating SEL into elementary math lessons is not only possible but highly beneficial—it promotes emotional intelligence, teamwork, and development of math skills.

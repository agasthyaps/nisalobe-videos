Most educators and students are navigating a rush of emotions during back-to-school time. But when teachers use evidence-backed strategies to start building relationships with intention right out of the gate, students start the new year with higher confidence, more self-awareness, and a stronger sense of belonging.

## Transcript

Narrator: The first day of school always brings a mix of emotions—anticipation, trepidation, and excitement. Jump-start the new year by putting intention to building strong relationships with students during the very first week.

Narrator: It’s common for students to have anxiety during times of major transition, but when young people reflect on how they can manage and overcome challenges right at the beginning of the school year, research has shown they are absent less often, are more academically successful, and have fewer behavior issues. Give students an opportunity to journal about what stresses them out during back-to-school time. Start with prompts like “How do you feel about your study habits?” “What are your plans to make new friends?” Grappling with these concerns right off the bat will help them develop problem-solving skills and self-awareness.

Narrator: Being intentional about the posters, decorations, and learning aids you choose for your classroom builds a sense of belonging for your students. Using images and examples that mirror your students’ own cultures has even been shown to boost grades. Do your best to make your classroom warm and inviting—a space that reflects the interests and backgrounds of your students. Try showcasing past student work to encourage a sense of ownership. And be sure to display visuals and short quotes that feature heroes and leaders from all walks of life to let students know they are all valued learners that are welcome in your classroom.

Narrator: When teachers go the extra mile to connect, students are more likely to engage with challenging lessons and activities. The most effective teachers balance relationships and rigor to create a supportive and productive classroom experience. Start from day one with classic relationship-building strategies like positive greetings at the door or playing the name game. Ask students to share a rose and thorn from their summer vacation as a quick way to get to know them better and help them feel seen.

Narrator: It can be tempting to begin the year with all your rules and policies already in place, but a heavy-handed approach can lead to power struggles in the long term. Instead, invite students to share responsibility for how the classroom is managed. Ask the class to generate a list of adjectives that describe the ideal learning environment, or dig into specific questions like “How do you want to treat each other?” Then write up agreements together, based on their answers, and display them on a poster board. This empowers students to feel ownership in their own classroom community and provides a visual reminder of their shared expectations.

Narrator: The first week of school is full of changes and unknowns for teachers and students. Building good relationships early on establishes the trust you’ll need to thrive in the year ahead.

## Article

At The Co-op School in Brooklyn, New York, the timeless game Simon Says is getting a fresh purpose. No longer just a playground favorite, when the game is used in the classroom, it’s a simple, effective way to manage daily tasks, have smooth transitions, and keep students engaged from one activity to the next. As preschool teacher Sarah Dolcin explains, Simon Says is “just another way of completing tasks in a fun way.” On any given day, the game might be used to line up for recess, tidy the room, collect supplies, or grab water bottles.

Students follow the leader’s directions only when they hear the phrase “Simon says.” Skip those magic words, and anyone who moves is caught—a lighthearted challenge that keeps everyone listening closely and thinking before they act. The beauty of this deceptively basic game is that it works on multiple levels. “It’s great to use for transitioning,” Dolcin notes, “and to practice self-control.” While students are laughing and moving, they’re also sharpening important skills—active listening, comprehension, impulse control, and even teamwork.

They have to tune in to the details of each command, process it quickly, and make sure they respond at just the right time. The activity also builds a sense of classroom community. When students are playing together, they’re not just completing chores or moving from one lesson to the next—they’re sharing moments of joy, laughter, and connection.

This positive energy makes it easier to shift between tasks and keeps the day running smoothly. Best of all, the rules are easy for everyone to understand, but flexible enough to match the day’s needs. A few quick commands can get the class moving, refocus attention, or wrap up an activity with energy and cooperation.

“It’s a simple game,” Dolcin says, “but at the same time it helps us achieve multiple goals at once.” To find more games for classroom transitions and management, look up the many articles that Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene has written for Edutopia.

## Transcript

Sarah Dolcin: All right, check your body. Are you in whole-body listening? Are you sitting on your bottoms? OK, let’s get ready for a round of Simon Says. Simon Says is a game that we played during our childhood, but it’s actually an effective game that we can use in the classroom to help with management. Simon says to grab your water bottles. We have these tasks every day, and it’s just another way of completing these tasks in a fun way. Simon says, “Put your hands up.” Today, I was Simon, the whole time. They should only do the action when I say, “Simon says.” Simon says to stand up. If I do not say, “Simon says,” then they do not do the action. Simon says to do three jumping jacks. And one, two, three. Turn around. Oh, Simon didn’t say. It’s great to use for transitioning. Simon says to walk to your line spot.

Student: Simon says to walk to your line spot.

Sarah Dolcin: And to practice self-control. Simon says to tiptoe like a mouse outside. Are you ready? Tiptoe. And it develops their listening skills, their comprehension skills, and also their social skills where they can work together as a team. Simon says to do giant steps. Are you ready? Get your feet ready and… It’s like a simple game, but at the same time, it does help us achieve multiple goals at one time. Simon says to skip, skip, skip.

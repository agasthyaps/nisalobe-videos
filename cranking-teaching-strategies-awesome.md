## Transcript

Students: Whoa!

Teacher: What do you see now?

Students: A penguin! I can see a boat!

Buddy Berry: Surprise and Delight is the heartbeat of our school. It is that element of fun, and excitement and engagement. It’s taking anything that you normally would do, and then trying to crank it up to something that’s awesome. It is embedded in every aspect of our culture. Even the space itself. We have holograms. We have vending machines that are stocked with student product. We have the hallway made of lava tiles.

Sherry Curtsinger: Surprise and Delights also happen within the classroom. Oftentimes we use technology. One of those Surprise and Delights that students love a lot, is the virtual field trip.

Teacher: Scientist. That’s right. What do you think the scientist is studying?

Student: The penguin?

Teacher: The penguins, maybe? He could be studying penguins, you’re right.

Sherry Curtsinger: You can change the place or the space, it can be just a treat, the activity itself. Ms.

Montgomery: Okay, so guys, you all remember that yesterday in class, we read “Doughnuts Don’t Lie” and the author Angela Wilkinson is a former graduate of Eminence High School.

Angela Wilkinson: Hello guys!

Students: Hi!

Daynisha: Today we had the opportunity to ask the author of the book “Doughnuts Don’t Lie” questions.

Angela Wilkinson: After publishing it, I did wonder. Will people like this book?

Daynisha: Then Ms. Montgomery, she gave us doughnuts. Ms.

Montgomery: I’ll go ahead and start this one down this way.

Student: They’re so good!

Sherry Curtsinger: The Surprise and Delight completely changes the school culture. It makes it fun and exciting, a great place to be.

Buddy Berry: We want kids to want to be here. We want them to be thinking differently, and to make them creative, and so Surprise and Delight, it triggers new ideas for everybody.

Student: Another clue!

Student: Clue.

Student: A ha!

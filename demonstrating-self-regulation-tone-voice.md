Courtney Daignault: Where do I need to go to begin my project? Tara, what is your plan? Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: Developing a calm, neutral, assertive voice is part of the teacher’s own self-regulation, which allows them to help students to be self-regulated and to be secure in the knowledge that the teacher will be receptive to them, but also in control.

Jennifer Krystopowicz: Alright, everyone partner up. Cynthia Robinson-Rivers: The tone of voice we try to use when we speak with our students is what we would call calm, neutral and assertive.

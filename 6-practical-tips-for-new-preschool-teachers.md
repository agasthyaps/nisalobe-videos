Narrator : Entering your first year of teaching comes with excitement, nerves, and questions about how you will find your way in your school, navigate relationships with students, and manage your classroom. For preschool and pre-K teachers, there are special considerations. Your young, curious students may be experiencing a classroom for the very first time. Here are six tips to help you become a confident, effective teacher of the littlest learners. Excitement is contagious. Leading your class with curiosity, exploration, and playful learning in mind engages children in vibrant ways and can ease anxieties for students who are new to a classroom environment. What you wear can play a major role in how you feel and move through activities in a pre-K classroom. Opt for comfortable clothing that allows for lots of movement, active play, and sitting on the floor with your students. Young children can develop sensory overload if a space has too many bright colors or too much clutter. Organize your room with intention. Encourage independence by storing supplies within students’ reach. And limit conflict by keeping different types of activity areas, such as reading and construction, separate. In preschool, transitions can be turbulent, and predictable routines are essential for young learners. Try using visual cues, such as a timer or picture schedules, to make expectations clear. Offer choice times between required routines where children have the ability to make decisions on their own and make transitions fun with songs, competitions, and games. You can learn a lot about your students by stepping back and simply observing the way they play, move around the room, and handle challenges. Make a habit of watching your class, and set aside time to take notes on how each child interacts with their world. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. No question is too small. Colleagues, administrators, and online teaching communities are all great at answering your great resources for information. Your first weeks in class will go much more smoothly if you know where to go for answers. When equipped with practical ways to handle the ups and downs of the first year in a preschool class, you can have a positive impact on your young students and their learning.

> When students pretend they’re at a fancy party making small talk, a simple brainstorm for writing ideas becomes more lively, more cooperative—and more effective.

## Article

There is a strong body of research indicating the benefits of movement and activity in the classroom. When combined with cooperative tasks, they can be a potent tool for learning. At Pierre Elliott Trudeau Elementary School in Gatineau, Quebec, third- and fourth-grade teacher Fiona Medley uses a playful strategy to get kids up out of their chairs and participating: She lets them wander around and chat about ideas with each other—while playing music.

Although she also employs traditional reading and writing activities to help her students develop language skills, Medley relies on music, movement, and other arts integration strategies to teach vocabulary, story structure, and active listening. When it comes time to write, students are inspired, creative, and more focused. To learn more about the research behind the practices seen in the video, check out the links below.

## Transcript

Fiona Medley: So we are at a sophisticated party. And you’re milling around. You’re saying hello.

Fiona Medley: The Milling to Music activity is a great one for brainstorming. It allows students that time to think about the subject, their own background knowledge. It allows them to have a personal opinion, and when we’ve been able to talk out the ideas in advance, when they set to writing, they’re not staring at a blank page. They already have those ideas in their head.

Fiona Medley: The students pretend that they are at a sophisticated party, and we turn on some music and they walk around. When the music stops, I ask them to get with an elbow partner, so someone who’s close by them. Then I would give them a little question to talk about.

Fiona Medley: OK. Face your partner. Now ask your partner, “Partner, what is it about winter that you really like?” Boy: I like sledding. What is it about, like, what do you like about winter?

Girl: I like building snowmen and— Fiona Medley: I do this five times maybe throughout the process, and each question is a little bit more thoughtful.

Fiona Medley: OK. So what is something in winter that really, really is a pet peeve?

Girl: Freezing toes and freezing hands while skiing.

Boy: Oh, yeah.

Girl: I love skiing. It’s just I don’t like when you get cold.

Boy: The same, but with skating.

Fiona Medley: And we’re working on their socialization skills, and it gets them thinking along the theme.

Fiona Medley: They benefit so much from orally expressing their ideas at the same time as moving their bodies, so that when I actually do ask them for 10 minutes of focused writing, they’re totally ready for it. It allows them a lot of success when they’ve done all of that brainstorming work.

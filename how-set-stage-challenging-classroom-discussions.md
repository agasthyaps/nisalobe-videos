## Transcript

Alison: I can discuss whether or not confederate monuments should be removed by listening to my peers and using evidence. Athen, can you please read the norms out loud to everybody?

Athen: “One speaker at a time. Assume best intentions.” Alison: Norms are very important to any discussion that we have. They ground us in sort of how to engage with each other appropriately.

Athen: “Show respect, friendship and courage. Speak with evidence.” Alison: And also allow us to have a fluid conversation that goes forward rather than stays on the same point again and again.

Athen: “Have an open mind. Agree and disagree politely. An example of that is, “”I appreciate your point, but I disagree with you because–“” Alison: And it builds respect. And I think those are all skills that they’re going to need when they encounter perspectives that are different than theirs.

Alison: Great! So there’s one norm on there that I really want to clarify for everybody. It’s, “Assume best intentions.” We’re talking about a very heated topic, right? This is an active debate in our country, and so it’s important to understand that even though somebody says something you might disagree with, that it’s not them attacking you personally, right? Everybody’s contributing to this shared dialog in this safe space.

Alison: Assume best intentions is probably the most important one with a hot button issue, and that’s really designed so everybody feels safe sharing their opinion.

Alison: So I want you to turn and talk for a minute with someone next to you. What is one of those norms that you’re going to focus on today. Thirty seconds, turn and talk.

Alison: I think another important one is to, “Show respect, friendship, and courage.” In a conversation like this that is so high stakes, these are really important and if students can demonstrate them, it will lead to the safe space and it will allow everybody a chance to participate.

Alison: Ryan, what is one norm that you’re going to focus on today?

Ryan: “Show respect, friendship, and courage.” Alison: And why is that important?

Ryan: So I respect other people’s opinions, and also that I share out loud when I share my opinion.

Alison: Great! So I will pose the question, and then we will just take it away. So, should confederate monuments be removed?

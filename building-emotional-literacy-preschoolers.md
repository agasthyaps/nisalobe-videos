## Transcript

Teacher: Okay. And I started the puzzle.

Thomas: Because our teachers teach self-regulation, our students are better able to manage their feelings.

Teacher: That’s a smile.

Student: No.

Teacher: Was angry?

Thomas: They’re better able to verbalize their emotions and what they’re going through.

Antonia: What’s wrong?

Teacher: How does this make you feel?

Thomas: They’re ready to speak about their problems and not react to their problems. And by doing that, they’re ready to go to their next level.

Thomas: If you looked into a typical classroom here at Educare, you’re, like, oh, all they’re doing is just playing all day. They’re just like they’re having fun. But there’s intentionality behind everything. One of the things that teachers focus on is self-regulation. I would say that skillset of self-regulation is actually the most important, and because you’re setting that child up for success.

Angie: We’ve realized that if a child is not able to actually focus and manage and cope, then they’re not learning. So conscious discipline is our research-based socio-emotional program that we use in the classrooms. Conscious discipline isn’t about managing behaviors. It’s about giving the students the tools to direct it themselves.

Antonia: I commit to use my big voice. I commit to listen to my friends’ big voices. I commit to using kind words. I commit to keep my classroom safe.

Student: I commit.

Angie: Conscious discipline gives the students and the teachers the language to work through things. It’s about using your words in a positive way.

Antonia: I’m trying to tell you something. Okay. You listen to her words. She’s using her big voice.

Antonia: You are safe. You are loved. You can handle this.

Antonia: In previous classrooms that I’ve had, we didn’t give them the means to articulate their feelings.

Antonia: Can you show me how you’re feeling right now? That’s angry and sad and happy and silly and tired and worried, surprised and scared and cranky. Which one are you feeling right now?

Antonia: If you don’t give them the language that they need, they can’t communicate what their needs are.

Antonia: Okay.

Antonia: But when we give them those big words, they’re, like, oh. I’m not scared. I’m not mad. But I’m frustrated. And they’ll know there’s nuances to how we feel and what we think.

Antonia: We’re always telling them use your words and not your hands. But what words?

Teacher: I don’t like when you grab my hood.

Antonia: When the kids are able to say I don’t like it when you push me, will you please stop, the other child knows what they did. And then, you have a relationship-building moment instead of a tension moment. If I do what I’m supposed to do when they are transitioning from early childhood to kindergarten, when they’re in second grade, they’ll be able to use these skills. And then, they can share them with their classmates in third grade, fourth grade. You won’t have the disruption. You can just teach.

Antonia: Remember, it’s my job to keep you safe and it’s your job– what’s your job?

Student: To stay that way.

Antonia: To stay that way. High five.

## Transcript

Daren Dickson: Victor, I love your ability to admit that you wanna do better at times, and then how committed you are to doing that. Circles are a time for the community to come together and develop themselves as individuals, develop their relationships, and really address community work. And we actually believe that by doing that, kids will succeed more academically because they feel safe and they’re in trusting relationships.

Student: Thanks.

Sarah Giblin: Valor is a middle school based in Nashville, Tennessee. We really value our relationships with each other, and we work really hard to create the school community that we want to be a part of. Circle is an important part of that work.

Daren Dickson: Our circle model is something that both our adults and our scholars do every week for an hour. Is there more you need to talk about?

Sarah Giblin: Circle happens in single-gender groups of about 20 or so students led by their mentor teacher.

Daren Dickson: That’s really impressive. Circle is done in a structured manner. It’s very different than the classroom experience that they have at other points during the day, kind of invites them to be exploring and learning in a different way. Every circle will follow the same basic cadence.

Matt Cutler: All right. We’re gonna start by doing our True North.

Daren Dickson: It’ll always start with what we call True North Practice.

Matt Cutler: Start by taking one silent, deep breath in, and then slowly letting it out.

Daren Dickson: It’s a mindfulness-based practice for everybody in the circle to let go of the busy day and really focus their attention on each other.

Matt Cutler: We are going to do a weather check-in. Who would like to start us off?

Daren Dickson: And then it moves into a check-in.

Student: Today, I’m feeling foggy because I’m sleepy.

Matt Cutler: Everybody has to check in, even if it’s minimal.

Student: I feel sunny because it’s Friday.

Matt Cutler: Being able to name their emotions, I think it humanizes everybody involved. It really helps us see each other as people who have feelings.

Daren Dickson: And then we move into what we call work.

Student: Outside of the classroom and not… Student: I was a little bit frustrated.

Daren Dickson: So this is the biggest step of the whole relationship work. You need to let Jerron know that you understand why he felt frustrated, okay? Communities need to work together in order to solve problems, and so people have the opportunity to bring work into circle.

Sarah Giblin: Examples of work are relationship work with your peers or with your teacher. We might have people take responsibility for something that had an impact on our community. We also do activities like sharing your life story, reflecting on your values.

Matt Cutler: So Eric, are you ready to do your presentation?

Eric: The topic I investigated was religion.

Matt Cutler: Scholars really push themselves and put a lot of effort and thought into the work. You see them starting to become more thoughtful about themselves, more self-aware.

Student: This experience helped me learn that I can be kinder to people with different perspectives.

Daren Dickson: Then we always end with appreciations.

Student: You always make me laugh.

Student: You always kept trying to get better.

Daren Dickson: It’s a way for the community to appreciate the positive impacts we have on each other.

Anuar: I like to appreciate you for talking to me over spring break. It’s like a mini family. It’s a place where you know you’re safe. I don’t talk about my feelings much, but in circle, I can because I know I can trust them.

Daren Dickson: I think having the adults do the practice themselves and really know the importance of it is our main strategy.

Sarah Giblin: In through your nose, and out through your mouth. Allow your breath to anchor you.

Daren Dickson: Adults drive this type of work in the community.

Sarah Giblin: Steven, would you mind kicking us off?

Steven Palmer: There’s some work that I’ve done with kids in this past week that I need to bring to circle. In circle today, I did a process called taking responsibility, which is used for repairing a relationship with the community as a whole. You step into the circle and you own whatever action you took. I recognize that my mistake put you in a really uncomfortable position. I have been at schools where if something were done and not talked about, it kinda festered. Here, you positively work to rebuild the relationship. Moving forward, I commit to using the systems that are in place and thinking before I act in such a way. I ask kids to do it every day, and I think that’s why Valor works is because everything the kids are asked to do, the adults are expected to do as well.

Samiyah: It helps a lot because they also know what we’re going through. Other schools can say, “You don’t understand your teachers,” but we can’t say that because they do the same thing as us, and they know what we’re going through.

Matt Cutler: Circle is a space that’s safe enough that we can share and it can be vulnerable. It also builds relationships that help us become better teachers, help them become better learners.

Voiceover: You guys did a really good job. Appreciate yourselves for that.

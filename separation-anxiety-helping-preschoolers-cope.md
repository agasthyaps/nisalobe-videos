# Helping Preschoolers Cope With Separation Anxiety

> When the youngest learners are given space and tools to process the intense emotions they feel when caregivers drop them off, they become more confident in a classroom setting—and build foundations for their lifelong school experience.

## Article

For preschoolers, being dropped off at school can be an overwhelming experience. What’s more, the fallout from separation anxiety can have a distracting effect on an entire class and make it difficult for teachers to move on with the lessons of the day. At the play-based Serra Preschool in San Francisco, California, teachers have put simple strategies in place—developing succinct goodbye routines, writing letters to caregivers, and sharing transitional comfort objects—to help equip young students with the skills to manage their emotions.

As a result, the little ones become more independent and resilient, and they can move on with the business of learning.

## Transcript

Teacher: Happy Monday!

Mary: OK. Go find teacher Kendall and go— Marybeth Cody: We honor that feeling of sadness that children have when they separate from their parents.

Marybeth Cody: See you later, dad.

Dad: I love you.

Marybeth Cody: Because we allow the space for children to feel these emotions, the children feel heard and feel empowered, so they are able to move happily throughout the day after that.

Marybeth Cody: The Sierra Preschool is a play-based, developmentally appropriate program. We have 47 children here ranging the age from 2 years to 5 1/2. Children need to feel comfortable, they need to feel safe, and sometimes they’re leaving their parents for the first time.

Child: I want my mommy.

Marybeth Cody: We also want them to expand their world in a safe, happy, joyful way.

Roxanne Barrett: Are frogs snakes?

Marybeth Cody: We’re always making observations of the children and determining where they are at any given time.

Mary: I think they’re looking specifically at each child and seeing what is calming them down, really just trying to build the trust between the teachers, help him see that everyone here are our friends, and they’ll be his friends.

Marybeth Cody: At the appropriate time, we either invite the parent to leave or they leave on their own; there is a script to it that becomes a simple task to be able to say goodbye effectively to your child.

Dad: Love you.

Marybeth Cody: And to leave them feeling happy about what comes next in their life.

Brennan: OK. You’ll play in here with teacher Roxanne, and I’ll take David on a walk for him to sleep.

Averil: That’s right, I will see you later.

Marybeth Cody: “What comes next before my mom comes back?” essentially is what they’re asking.

Kendall Wood: Bye, Mom!

Marybeth Cody: If a child is fretting at that time, you’ll see the letter writing coming out, and we do write letters. We take that dictation, then begin to identify those feelings they have and allow for that space for them to feel that.

Kendall Wood: And then where should I write “Ben,” right here?

Ben: Yes!

Kendall Wood: Great, now we know that’s your picture.

Braden: They just write a note to my mom and dad, if I miss them, then I bring it home in my backpack.

Sherri Irving: All right, so, this is the ice cream place.

Marybeth Cody: It’s very important to have home life and school life knit as closely as possible; the parents are asked to send photos of their family, and gradually children want to talk about their experiences and about who is in their family.

Jennifer Yi: Tell your friends what is this?

Marybeth Cody: Monday is sharing day, and a child brings something from home and is encouraged to share that story that comes with that.

Jennifer Yi: Can all your friends touch it?

Child: Yeah.

Jennifer Yi: All right. You passed it to your friend Sloan.

Marybeth Cody: These are life skills that we’re giving them. It continues to amaze me how effective it is in such a short time. What you put into a child initially carries through each year, so you’ll see no separation issues with the 4-year-olds or the kindergarten program with the 5-year-olds. They come in, they know the routine, they jump right into the curriculum, and the day goes on… happily.

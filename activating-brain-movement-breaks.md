## Transcript

Falon Turner: Alright, friends, who wants to do the breathing technique? Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: One of the things that actually improves the architecture of the brain is movement and physical activity. In this classroom, you can really see the mind-body connection and how both the mindfulness activities and the movement activities allow children to free their brains and be prepared to learn. Cynthia Robinson-Rivers: Throughout the morning, we’ll either stop and do a breathing technique, some kind of mindfulness strategy, or a movement break understanding that, one, little kids can’t attend for that long, or be still for that long. Two, if we do have a certain percentage of kids with toxic stress, they have high amounts of cortisol and the way to release that is through physical movement.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: Cortisol, and a fight or flight reaction, will make it hard to pay attention to learning. Very often, practices like movement breaks enable children to get more self-regulated and calmer, and therefore open to a learning experience. Many teachers will lead activities themselves. Some will project images and using a person onscreen who helps take kids through a different movement activity.

Student: First we are going to do the pretzel.

Falon Turner: I slowly got to do the pretzel. So they breath in, deep inhale, exhale, deep inhale, exhale. Basically, just to relax them, calm them down.

Student: Next we are going to do the breathing ball. Cynthia Robinson-Rivers: Our PE teacher and our yoga teacher that we contract with have also taught the teachers different strategies to use, and so you’ll see them implementing that throughout the day.

Teacher: Sometimes you may feel nervous, you may feel a little anxious, you may not know what to do, but you can always stop, take a deep breath, and- Student: Relax.

Student: Relax.

Dr.

Pamela Cantor: This idea of children sitting for long periods of time, they aren’t naturally wired to do that. So rather than put them in a position where they have to act out to demonstrate that they need to be able to move, building in movement breaks means that they will get some of the stress relief, some of the energy release that they need in order to be able to get calm again and pay attention to learning. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: In fact, physical activity is equally important for adolescents and adults to keep the mind clear, to relieve stress, to be ready to learn.

Students at Concourse Village Elementary School practice giving and receiving feedback using a TAG Critique worksheet .

## Transcript

Teacher: You have three minutes for your TAG feedback. T, tell something you like. A, ask a question. G, give a suggestion. TAG is our schoolwide critique process. It’s a very quick formative way to say, “Hey, this is what you did great, and here are your next steps.” At the completion of a lesson, they select which work they want to critique. We have a TAG protocol sheet to write their feedback. You always want to start with a positive, something that the student did well. Then A, ask a question. Why did you make this decision? How did you do that? And then G, give a suggestion, what they can do to improve their work. They share out their feedback and their next steps.

Student: I like how Sebastian did the sky behind the buildings.

Teacher: When they come in for their next session, they’re all ready to go, applying feedback.

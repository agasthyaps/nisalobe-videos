## Article

Many teachers want their classroom to be a place where learning is more joyful, but with the demands of content standards, time pressures, and classroom management, that can sometimes feel out of reach. In Denmark, some schools have solved this challenge by adopting an instructional coaching model: Educators trained in playful learning collaborate and consult with teachers regularly to help infuse socialization, activity, creativity, and meaning into their lessons. At Vorbasse School in Billund, when playful learning guide Maria Astrup Bendixen worked with math teacher Nicolaj Bech, they transformed a statistics lesson into a more connected and memorable experience for his middle school students.

## Transcript

Maria: When we were introduced to doing playful learning, some of the staff said, “Why? Why do I have to play?” So, it has been a challenge for some to make their lessons more playful because, “Why wasn’t it good enough? Don’t we do enough already?” That’s why we were given the roles we’ve got right now. We help them with their teaching, give them ideas and feedback on how to make their lessons more playful.

Maria: And make that actively engaging by going and questioning the other classes.

Camilla: The culture of the school is not easy to change, but I think for many years we have had a culture here at Vorbasse School. We are saying, “OK, this is new. Let’s try it.” Instead of, “Oo, ah, no, I don’t want this, it’s new and I’m scared.” [Laughs.] You have to be brave.

Maria: Yeah.

Camilla: And then say, “OK, we’re doing it together.” Maria: Mmm.

Camilla: We tried.

Maria: Yep.

Nicolaj: They have to work with statistics of some sort because that’s our topic in math right now. But I need some ideas on how to make it a bit more fun, a bit more playful.

Maria: So, maybe they should— Nicolaj: But I don’t think it ever came natural to me. I was one of the students who always, you know, I got an assignment and I sat down and I liked doing these assignments on my own. I didn’t really want to get up and do all kinds of things. But from what I’ve seen and the effect it has on some students, especially the ones who struggle, it’s really amazing to see.

Maria: Then make it socially active. They need to do something with each other.

Nicolaj: Instead of giving them data for the project, maybe they could visit the other classes?

Maria: Yeah, they could go interview the other ones.

Nicolaj: Yeah.

Nicolaj: So, Maria and I, we work very well together. She’s just been good at bringing up certain ideas. I don’t have to have all the ideas.

Maria: It’s a way to engage structured play with an overall goal and with the lessons. We have to make it socially engaging. There’s been a lot of studies that if you do something with others, you will learn more where you’re more motivated.

Nicolaj: We wanted for the students, instead of giving them data to make statistics on, we wanted them to go out and ask instead.

Nicolaj: Today, we have to work with statistics, which means you in your new groups, you have to go into the other classes, and then you go from student to student and you ask, “What do you have for Christmas dinner?” When you get back in here, you have to present it on a chart.

Nicolaj: We wanted them to get up and move and talk to people.

Students: <Speaking Danish> Maria: Some of the students were motivated and found it engaging and fun, but some of them were scared. They had to go out of their comfort zone and try something new, and they just wanted to get to know, “How do I need to answer this question? And when do I need to hand in the paper?” They had to do it a lot of time until they found out that the learning sticks with them in another way. They remember what they have done because it has been an entire experience.

Maria: So, now they are convinced. Now they love it and now they demand more of it. Because we are conducting lessons in another way, so we are showing the students that we want to get to know them, we want to engage them, motivate them, and make it meaningful. So, they actually give us more of who they are because the teaching is more personalized.

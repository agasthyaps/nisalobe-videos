## Transcript

Karen: Sports are a natural opportunity for social and emotional skill building, because sports are often done in teams. Sports are goal-oriented, so we have multiple opportunities for problem-solving. Because of the element of practice in a sport, that allows you to see very visible growth, and allows young people who may be struggling academically to come into a situation in which they can see what happens when they actually practice and get better.

Caleb: We’re going to half court, right? Just wait, let me go in first.

Student: Yeah, and go in a circle.

Eric: Our athletic space is clearly our most popular space. When kids come here, they want the ability to run around and they want to play games. But it’s also the place that we experience them not being able to regulate their emotions. By incorporating the social emotional supports, and by training our staff who is in the gym, we are able to see kids in an environment that generally creates a lot of conflict and a lot of emotion and a lot of reaction, and we’re able to grow the social and emotional learning aspects and allow all kids to be successful.

Caleb: We are going to play flag football. Does that sound good?

Students: Yeah.

Caleb: We do an ice breaker where each kid will toss a ball around and there’s questions on the ball. They’ll read the question and answer it.

Denyah: What is your favorite cereal? Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

Caleb: That’s a good one.

Denyah: It was a good way to get to know our teammates, because it will tell us a little bit about each other and we would like, know a little about the person, so we could get along with them, and then we can know them even better.

Caleb: All right, guys, we’ll come and get some flags on. Within sports, a lot of these SEL skills are already innate. So things like emotion regulation, how to deal with adversity, self-awareness, setting goals for ourselves.

Trae: Caleb has taught me a lot of things that can help me in life. If we get upset, he lets us cool down and then we talk about it. He’ll tell us a more respectful way to say what we want to say, or the tone we should be saying it in. He’ll help us set a goal for what we want to do. He’ll help us just be a better person in general.

Caleb: My hope for the players that are in my gym is not just get better at sports, but to also get better as a human being and learn how to care for others as well as ourselves.

Brooke: Just making sure that we’re really getting to know those students on a more individual basis is such a core component of SEL.

Hannah: Really stretch out those legs. Get warmed up. We always start with a warmup, and I use that warmup time to try to touch base with each of the kids during that warmup. That’s kind of my time to check in, how you’re doing? Are you good? Do you need anything?

Keiara: Me and Hannah are really close. I kind of got close to her with our love for volleyball.

Hannah: In games, all of you freak out about serving, right?

Students: Yeah.

Hannah: That’s like everyone’s least favorite part.

Keiara: Serving’s something that’s really hard for me in games, because I like, freak out. But I think practice really helps.

Karen: Feedback in general is critically important for young people. They need reactions in order to then calibrate their next actions. In sports, as in any other kind of activity, we need to keep the stakes right. Naming the skills, not just “You kicked the ball well,” but, “You reacted to that problem well. You adjusted well. You were able to regulate those emotions well.” Sports are really a place that it’s highly emotional, it’s highly engaging, and because you have a lot of social and emotional cognitive work going on, you have a huge opportunity to comment on it.

Hannah: When they get to reflect that, “Hey, I actually– I got better at this skill. I did better at this today,” it shows that they’re improving themselves and that they can do it, and I hope that they can bring that outside our club too. Nice and easy, Keiara, you got it. Yeah, good job!

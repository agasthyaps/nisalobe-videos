## Transcript

Sheriaha: Luckily, I have always had an artsy side and, so, I continue to explore other outlets and interests. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: The most important thing from an educator’s perspective is to create opportunities for teachers to know children well and understand what they’re experiencing. So, we need a school environment in which the children are being listened to and their experiences are being lifted up and sought out. The more we allow rich experiences and affirming relationships to be part of the educational environment, the more people’s brains grow.

Javaun: The last four years have highs and lows.

Thabiti Brown: Senior talks are one of my favorite traditions here at Codman Academy. Our students get up on stage and talk about who they are and how they developed. You talk about the ways in which you as a student have grown over time at Codman and explain why you should be ready to graduate.

Javaun: The three most important parts of my life is, number one, family; number two, friends; and, number three, basketball. Basketball has kept me from making poor choices, like skipping school– I would go through like some challenges, but when I play basketball all I think about is all the new people I’m meeting and the new experience I’m having. I’ve learned that dedication and collaboration are crucial. I keep pushing forward to make everyone in my family proud, especially my mom. Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond: Particularly in a diverse society like the United States, a good environment is a culturally competent one in which the experiences that children bring from different backgrounds are respected and acknowledged and supported and shared so that people understand each other and how they experience the world.

Sheriaha: Honestly, I can say I have lived a pretty decent life. I have love from my family and, most importantly, I love myself. Sadly, great times do not last forever. It felt like you’re writing a diary entry, like, you’re just pouring everything out. I did not want to feel the pain alone so I made sure everyone else felt it, too. It felt good to look back and know this was what was stopping me and this was what made me act out in school. I started to realize that no one had my back and supported me like my mother. I am glad I went through what I went through. You hate every second of the pain you have to deal with, but when you look back you become grateful for it because your experiences, good or bad, shape you into who you are. I let go of the pain. Yeah. I let go of the pain. My advice to the community is do not let anything that is meant to tear you down, tear you down. Do not give the past the key to your future. Thank you.

Thabiti Brown: It is not enough to say, “This is what’s hard about the world.” We need to educate our children to go and change things in the world.

Javaun: I think I’m walking away from this experience with the ability to share more and be vulnerable.

Thabiti Brown: We want our students to be able to explain the ways in which their journey has helped them be comfortable in who they are, confident about who they are, so that when the world comes for them, they are ready to also come to the world.

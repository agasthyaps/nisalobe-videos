Quick, mid-lesson checks for understanding are a crucial way to evaluate student progress and comprehension without relying on—or waiting for—intimidating, high-stakes exams at the end of a unit. These 7 formative assessment activities are quick, fun, and useful for spotting fuzzy understanding in real time—which is important when gauging whether to move on or circle back for a reteach. Creativity is at the heart of an Idea Doodle , where students are tasked with visually representing the day’s concept with a quick drawing.

Seeing how they translate their ideas into a visual format without the help of language makes it clear how solidly the class has grasped the day’s teaching. The next set of strategies are all about speed. With Rapid Recall, Quick Sort , and Whiteboard Relay , students react quickly to complete a challenge that tests their comprehension.

The teacher flashes a word, symbol, or image to the class and poses a connected question for Rapid Recall, and students then call out their answer as quickly as possible. Similarly, in a Whiteboard Relay, groups of students race to answer a set of questions the quickest, placing the miniature whiteboard on their head when finished. For the bell ringer activity called Quick Sort, students compete to match vocabulary terms to corresponding concepts and prove that they completed the previous night’s homework assignment.

One-Question Quiz is a mini-assessment that poses a single question to the class at a critical moment. Their responses—whether written in individual whiteboards, jotted down on a sheet of paper, or shared via a student response system—will offer an up-to-the-minute glimpse of how well they are grasping the material. Formative assessments are also helpful for designing successive lessons, as shown in the strategies Help Me Plan and Student Takeaways.

In Help Me Plan, students are brought into the lesson planning process and divided into small groups to give feedback on how much they absorbed from class and what felt most difficult. In Student Takeaways, each class member is asked to write one concrete takeaway from the day on the board. Both strategies require students to express the headline concepts from the day’s lesson and, in doing so, reveal the parts that remain murky.

## Transcript

Narrator: Formative assessment is the art of gauging student comprehension during the act of learning. It helps locate points of fuzzy understanding, and highlights the mastery levels students should be aiming for. These seven low-stakes strategies will help you check whether you need to circle back for a reteach, or if your class is ready to move on. Pictures not only speak louder than words; sometimes, they can help highlight gaps in knowledge. Ask students to visually represent the day’s topic through a quick doodle. Whether they’re drawing an idea as literal as, say, the water cycle or something less visually obvious like the themes in a novel, students must synthesize their knowledge of a concept to creatively express it in their sketch. This activity tests students’ ability to quickly recall information from the day’s lesson. Flash a word, symbol, or image to the class for three seconds, and follow it up with a connected question to see what stuck. Or in a world language class, use a fill-in-the-blank to have students call out words from the day’s vocabulary. A quick sorting challenge as a bell ringer can help reveal who did and didn’t complete their homework. Challenge students to match vocabulary terms to concepts from last night’s assignment as quickly as possible. As the students connect and categorize terms, it will become clear where to pick things up from the previous class’s teachings. There’s nothing like a relay race to get students engaged. Pass out small whiteboards to each group, and provide a prompt that they’ll solve in sequence. Tasks like conjugating verbs of different tenses or naming the noble gasses in the periodic table work well. The first group to complete the prompt places the whiteboard on their head and yells, “Finished.” With a one-question quiz, timing is everything. At a critical moment in the lesson, when understanding will determine whether to move on or reinforce learning, pose a single question to the class. The question can be multiple choice, short answer, or true/false. Using their whiteboard, a printed handout, or a student response system, every student responds simultaneously, providing a quick snapshot of comprehension. This simple activity offers a way to quickly see what content stayed with your class and what got left behind. Ask students to write one brief takeaway from the day’s lesson on the board. Altogether, they form a collective representation of the class’s understanding. Students can browse the takeaways and learn from their peers, and you can circle back to the concepts that need more attention. Students appreciate being brought into the lesson planning process. Divide the class into small groups, and ask them to discuss how the day’s learning went. Visit with each group to hear about their experiences. What concepts were easily understood? Which need to be investigated more deeply or are worth reviewing in tomorrow’s class? By measuring student comprehension with low-stakes formative assessments, you can ensure that your class is truly grasping the curriculum as you’re teaching it.

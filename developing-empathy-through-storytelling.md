## Article

As part of the EL Education network , the staff at Casco Bay High School in Portland, Maine, strive to make work meaningful and relevant to students. In longtime teacher Susan McCray’s 11th-grade English Language Arts classroom, students strengthen their writing skills, tap into creativity, and develop a deep sense of empathy through a storytelling expedition. In this multistep project, groups of four students interview people in the community who have shown strength in the face of hardship or injustice.

Each group meets with its interviewee twice, homing in on stories of courage and resilience. They record both interview sessions, transcribe them, and then get to work to bring them to life onstage. Back in the classroom, students work together to capture the essence of the community member’s story: They identify key moments, storyboard, create a script, and memorize it—a skill that has fallen by the wayside in many classrooms.

Each team then works with a guest theater teacher, adding movement for emphasis and blocking the three-minute piece onstage. The project culminates with a powerful and moving live storytelling performance for the community, with the original interviewees in attendance. McCray has been doing this project with her students for years, and it has evolved over time.

At the heart of it, she wants the work to matter to students. “There’s an opportunity for real growth in so many ways—just from the interview itself and then from having to get up on that stage and have it all memorized and project out into an audience.” The performance is important, but McCray emphasizes the process even more. “My hope is by the end you feel really good about yourself, and you realize you can do things you didn’t think you could do.” To find more tools and strategies to support projects that use storytelling to develop empathy and perspective-taking, read Jessica Fagen’s article for Edutopia, “ Teaching Oral History in Ethnic Studies Classes ,” or Abeer Shinnawi’s piece, “ Harnessing the Power of Storytelling to Support Migrant and Immigrant Students .”

## Transcript

Greta: I think I’m going to start first up here. And then because everybody echoes, “Not safe,” after me. Susan McCray: Because we’re writing scripts and taking it to a stage, kids have an opportunity to stretch and grow and see what they’re capable of. It’s challenging, but you get people up and moving and working together, and it’s fun.

Group: And then all this happened.

Greta: OK.

Group: Yeah, if we say… I think that’s not bad. I think if we go… Greta: Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Susan McCray: We are an expeditionary learning school, which means that our curriculum is designed around expeditions. Expeditions are interdisciplinary and project-based, and they’re about having an authentic product for an authentic, real audience. But really, at the heart of that is we want work to matter to kids. Susan McCray: We’re going to check all the feedback that we gave you before and make sure those final visions are in. The People of Portland Project is working to highlight someone who has inspired you because they have experienced hardship or injustice and they’ve shown great courage and resilience.

Student: So I moved to Portland and we went to the shelter in the middle of the night. Susan McCray: Students work in teams, and each team meets with their interviewee.

Greta: Our first interview went really well. I was the interviewer, and then the other people in my group was doing sound. Some were taking notes, observing the way she spoke and how she said things so when we perform it, we say it the same way.

Student: My dad died when I was very young. I was co-parenting with my mom despite my young age.

Greta: I graduated with my master’s. She gets her bachelor’s.

Student: Don’t we play a… Greta: We made a narrative art and placed her story. We did her conflict, her exposition, we did her climax, we did her falling action. Susan McCray: Then we’re grabbing words and figuring out which words are the words that actually really tell that story. You’ve decided that it’s OK that people are saying different things at the same time.

Greta: I really love this project because it’s really like telling. And then I think we step back, so you can walk this way.

Student: Yeah. And then we did step back.

Greta: And it gets to put you in other people’s shoes because we are performing it. Susan McCray: There’s an opportunity for real growth in so many ways.

Student: We never knew what happened with the money, so we would be starving.

Student: “And we never knew what happened with the money.” Greta: “So we would be starving.” Susan McCray: Just from the interview itself and then from having to get up on that stage.

Student: And I’m here to welcome you to the Casco Bay High School People of Portland Project. Susan McCray: And have it all memorized and project out into an audience.

Greta: I was fighting, and I remember I grabbed onto a plant. Susan McCray: My hope is by the end, you feel really good about yourself and you realize you can do things you didn’t think you could do.

Greta: And through all that trauma, I’m grateful to say that I’m now with my family.

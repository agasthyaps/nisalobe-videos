## Article

When P.S. 249, the Caton School, in Brooklyn, New York, saw that attendance on Fridays was consistently low, the staff came up with Super Science Fridays—an immersive science day when hands-on activities and cross-curricular investigations would give students an incentive to come to school and help get them reinvigorated and excited about learning. Students wear lab coats and think like scientists, and throughout the day the regular blocks for math, writing, and reading all relate to the science content they are studying. As a result, attendance and engagement improved—and so did science learning.

## Transcript

Rebecca Germiniano: Did we get a bright? Did we get a dark? Did we get a medium?

Student: Medium.

Rebecca Germiniano: Super Science Friday is a way to give students a chance to grow their love of science. There’s hands-on activities. We’ve got dances, they have lab coats. So, it’s just an exciting way to get them empowered and feeling confident about tackling science.

Rebecca Germiniano: Think about what works and what didn’t. Because scientists can do things more than once.

Students: Once!

Rebecca: Good morning.

Elisa Brown: Good morning, everybody.

Elisa Brown: The vision of the school is to give children a great first start when they come through our doors.

Elisa Brown: Good morning, good morning.

Elisa Brown: Friday used to be a heavy day for absences to occur. So, we came up with Super Science Friday to get kids excited. And we saw the improvement in attendance.

Rebecca Germiniano: We integrate science throughout all of the blocks of the day. As soon as they walk in in the morning, they get their lab coats. Currently we’re in a light and sound unit where they’re engineers trying to create a scene from a puppet show. They need to have different amounts of light, bright, dark, and medium.

Rebecca Germiniano: So, today, we’re going to read Let’s Test! And the kids in this book are trying to test a solution to their problem.

Kaylee: So, the book was about a girl and a boy selling lemonade. But the sun was blocking their eyes.

Rebecca Germiniano: They’re trying to create some shade, so they test different materials until they find one that provides the right amount of light and darkness.

Kaylee: So, they tried blankets, foam.

Zaydn: And a bed sheet. And the bed sheet was just right. The bed sheet made a medium bright light.

Rebecca Germiniano: We’re going to use that thinking in our own investigation. We’re going to set up our investigation stations.

Rebecca Germiniano: They were able to test the materials to see which ones would be effective for their goal.

Student: That’s too dark.

Kaylee: Maybe we could try this one?

Student: This looks like it’s medium.

Rebecca Germiniano: Once students had the material of their choosing, they were able to start creating the entire scene.

Rebecca Germiniano: All right, so we planned, we made a design. Now we’re going to throw everything away.

Class: No!

Rebecca Germiniano: No, we have to— Class: Test!

Rebecca Germiniano: Are we ready, scientists?

Class: Whoa. Ooooh.

Rebecca Germiniano: Did your scene work?

Kaylee: It kind of looks like a person.

Zaydn: Our table added so many shapes that when we tried to test how our design worked, it looked like somebody with triangle hair.

Rebecca Germiniano: And when they shined their flashlight on it, what happened, Kaylee?

Kaylee: It looked different.

Rebecca Germiniano: They had so many pieces blocking the bright area that they couldn’t see their scene.

Zaydn: My next step for next week is to remove some pieces and put it in a different spot.

Rebecca Germiniano: Sketch what you did today and write your findings. Did you meet the design goal? And how?

Rebecca Germiniano: So, the writing at the end ties into our nonfiction writing standards. And it’s just a way for them to reflect on what learning they did, what they felt successful about, or perhaps unsuccessful about.

Zaydn: I was writing how sometimes things work and sometimes things do not work as a scientist.

Rebecca Germiniano: Sometimes as scientists we got to do it— Kaylee: Again.

Rebecca Germiniano: Again.

Rebecca Germiniano: With Super Science Friday bringing in that integration to their normal reading, writing, and other areas, makes it feel like just a natural part of the learning environment and gives them confidence to try new things.

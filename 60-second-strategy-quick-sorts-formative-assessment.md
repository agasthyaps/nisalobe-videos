## Article

On many days, in Jess Quiggle’s social studies class at Fairview High School , in Fairview, Pennsylvania, high school students walk in to find envelopes on their tables. After settling in, Quiggle gives them the go signal, and they dump the contents out. Quickly they begin to sort little pieces of paper, often onto a graphic organizer that Quiggle has provided each table.

Each card has a concept or vocabulary term related to the previous night’s homework topic. Table groups are tasked with categorizing all their cards as fast as possible—and they hardly notice that the game is actually helping their teacher with formative assessment. For example, after having learned about the demographic transition model , students were tasked with sorting terms like “high birth rate” or “negative population growth” into stages 1–5 (shown as columns on their graphic organizers).

Quiggle circulates the room while students work, and when a group thinks they have it right, she is called over to check. Once a table has everything correct, everyone stops, and they review as a class. “What I love about Quick Sorts is that anyone can do it in any class or (with) any content.

As long as you have vocabulary terms or examples or things that can fit together, it’s really just like putting together a big puzzle and having the kids figure it out for you.” While Quiggle uses it as a quick formative assessment, the benefits of the game don’t stop there. It encourages both collaboration and competition. “I think it motivates them to work a little bit harder, and try to correct each other’s thinking as they go, because they don’t want to get it wrong.

They want to see if their team can beat the other teams in the class.” To find more quick teaching strategies for high school, scroll to the bottom of Edutopia’s 60-second strategies collection .

## Transcript

Jess Quiggle: All right, so at your tables we have your demographic transition sort. Quick Sorts is a formative review of a concept that we have been studying in class that works as a great bell ringer to figure out if the kids did their homework and if they understood the topics. So the first step is the students come in to see the envelopes on their table with all of the cards that they need to categorize. Dump out your little piece of paper. The students dump out the cards and try to put them in their correct categories.

Student: This is Japan. Do we have high birth rates, high death rates? Wait, no, we can’t have both here.

Jess Quiggle: I’m walking around while they’re doing this, giving them feedback and helping them out. Students will call me over if they think they have it all correct. I’ll check their answers. Right. Those ones are wrong. See if you figure out where they go. And once somebody has it right… You guys got it. We got one. Everybody stops and we’ll review it as a group. Stage two… One great thing about a Quick Sort is anyone can do it in any class or any content. It tells me where the gaps are in their knowledge so that I know what I have to address moving forward.

Jess Quiggle: It’s good?

Student: Yeah.

Jess Quiggle: Nice job.

# 60-Second Strategy: Heat Warm-Ups

> Differentiated levels of “heat” for these math worksheets mean every student starts class feeling both challenged and accomplished.

## Article

A couple of years ago, high school math teacher Jennifer Feehan taught a group of English language learners who had a wide range of math skills. Some students were catching up on their positive and negative signs, while others were ready to solve equations. To start each class, she needed an activity that would engage students at all levels.

And heat warm-ups were born. But she has a student to thank for the activity’s name. “It came about because one of my students—I was just calling them level warm-ups—he went, ‘Miss, this problem is hot peppers.

They just get harder and harder and hotter and hotter like hot peppers!’” Today, Feehan starts most classes by giving students a worksheet with at least four problems of increasing difficulty. Their level is indicated by an emoji: a fire extinguisher is the coolest, or easiest, problem, while a problem with four flames is the hardest. Students can choose where to begin, and they complete as many problems as they can within a set time period—usually 10 minutes.

This approach guarantees that no student is bored, and it puts agency in the hands of the students to take on their own challenges. An added benefit of the practice is that students often stretch themselves, because of the competition aspect. “Even my kids that were struggling,” says Feehan, “they didn’t want to feel like they were getting left out of something.

It helped their confidence when they went, ‘Oh, well, I don’t have to do just the first one or the first two. I was able to do the third one!’”

## Transcript

Jennifer Feehan: Heat warm-up, heat warm-up, heat warm-up. If they see me hanging out at the door and I have a stack of paper in my hands, they’re getting a heat warm-up. They get at least four questions. Their first question is a basic computational problem. And then I just keep adding a level of rigor to the questions. Students choose the difficulty level. The hotter the emoji, the harder the problem. They’ll work by themselves, or they’ll talk to the people next to them.

Student: How did you get this? This is a two.

Jennifer Feehan: I’ll circulate the room because I want to see the students that flip it over and try the hard one first versus the ones that start with the first one. That’s a beautiful step. That’s a beautiful step. I usually give them 10 minutes. I say, OK, let’s go over this. So my first step is I’m going to write this as nine. With heat warm-ups, they’re very willing to take on challenges. It becomes a competition of who could do the harder problems. And it actually helped their confidence. When they went, “I was able to do the third one.” If you can do flame three, you’re in good shape for what we’re doing in the next couple of units.

## Article

Whiting Lane Elementary School , in West Hartford, Connecticut, is a school that celebrates the diversity of their students—more than 30 different languages are spoken in the building—through cultural ambassadors. The program, developed by an English as a Second Language (ESOL) teacher, is one way they show their commitment to inclusivity—and to making all families feel like they belong. Family members serving as cultural ambassadors are invited to come into the classroom, read a book in their native language, and share aspects of their home culture with the class.

Students compare elements of the language with English and are given space to ask lots of questions. As a result, classmates develop a deeper knowledge and appreciation of cultures around the world, and families feel truly welcomed by the school community.

## Transcript

Saeed: [Speaks Farsi] Gar Dawson: Because of our Cultural Ambassador program, my students benefit from hearing other languages, seeing other languages in print. They benefit from learning more about our students’ families and their traditions and cultures. It’s a way to create the sense of belonging that everybody is welcome in our classroom community.

Karen Kukish: At Whiting Lane, we are very fortunate to have over 30 different languages that are spoken here within our building. We are true partners with our families, so we want to have them come in and share their culture and their background and their language and their traditions and their food. Our Cultural Ambassador program was a program started here by our ESOL teacher.

Saeed: My name is Saeed, Nikan’s father.

Dawson: I’ve had several parents come in every year. They come in to read a story, usually in their native language, and I read the same story in English prior.

Dawson: Mr. Sadr is going to read Don’t Cry, Sly . You heard this in English on Monday.

Saeed: Some languages, like Arabic, same as Farsi, start from right.

Dawson: It does create a sense of curiosity in the kids. Their questions were about the language.

Student: Does Farsi language take longer to read?

Saeed: Mostly, yeah, it’s longer than English.

Dawson: The parents are welcome to add another element of their culture if they would like.

Saeed: I want to explain about the Norouz. It is the first day of spring.

Dawson: So he also showed us how they celebrate the holiday of Norouz.

Saeed: This is the big celebration in our country, Iran. Right now, for the first of spring, we have a big celebration because of the new year. Prepare with wheat.

Dawson: The students said they had never heard about it, so it was new learning for all, including myself. And his son was very proud to be up there and be a part of it and share their culture and traditions with us.

Nikan: [Speaking Farsi] Nikan: My dad, he knows a lot about Farsi, more than me.

Saeed: It’s beautiful. Yeah, you can just, you know, we know about the language, we know about the culture. It makes us be more friendly, people or student together.

Dawson: It is a real esteem booster for the child. We’re acknowledging their parent as somebody who’s important to us. So he was kind of beaming today.

Nikan: I just feel happy and excited.

Saeed: [Speaks in Farsi] Kukish: I think it goes back to students really feeling like they belong. So when a child is in a school and they feel like, “Oh, I’m special and I matter,” you really build that intrinsic and internal motivation to succeed and to excel, and students really begin to feel like, “OK, I can do this. And I’m happy here and I feel safe and I feel accepted.” And when you have that as a base, the learning follows.

Dawson: Put your finger on your nose if you learned something new today. I certainly did.

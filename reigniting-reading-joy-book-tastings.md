## Article

Samantha Sova, an English language arts teacher at Fauquier High School in Warrenton, Virginia, has heard it time and time again: “I hate reading.” In her efforts to inspire students to enjoy reading, she sees value in giving them choice. “If they like what they’re reading,” she notes, “they’ll actually do it.” To maximize students’ options, Sova takes her class to the school library regularly. There, the librarians regularly offer an activity called a book tasting, where five-minute timers prompt students to rotate among tables that each represent a different genre.

The librarians offer a wide variety of books at each table, including graphic novels, novellas, and verse novels. Students learn how to quickly sample a new book by reading the back cover, the inside flap, and the first few pages. When they find one that interests them, they write down the title and a few quick notes on a book tastings handout the librarians have provided.

As the students move through, Sova and the librarians visit different tables and share summaries of books they’ve read previously, offering their recommendations. Once students have visited all of the tables, they rank the books they’ve written down and check out their number one pick. Again and again, Sova has seen students who swore they hated reading change their tune after the book tastings—they leave the library with a book (or two or three!) in hand, excited to give reading another try.

To hear a teacher’s perspective on encouraging reading with book tastings in her classroom, read Emma Tackett’s article, “ Giving Students a Little Taste of a Book .” To learn more about why book choice can be so valuable for engaging young readers, check out the video from Edutopia’s popular How Learning Happens series, Motivating Students With Book Choice .

## Transcript

Rebecca Webster: Her plane goes down. She’s by herself. She’s on a raft. She has a bottle of water and a bag of Skittles. And that’s all she has.

Rebecca Webster: We have a lot of students who tell us that they have very negative relationships with reading, and so it is important for them to see that there are some books that they might enjoy, not even just for an assignment, but just to read, and books that they can see themselves in. I want them to gain the skill of finding something that they would want to spend time with.

Becca Isaac: Fauquier High School is not that far from Washington, D.C., but it’s kind of rural at the same time. It’s a nice community to be part of. We set up the library like a cafe or a bookstore. We want them to be able to find what they want and what they love to read on their own more. Today we had Mrs. Sova’s ninth-grade English class come in to do a book tasting.

Audrey: They compared it to tasting appetizers at a restaurant. I thought it was a fun way to, like, instead of committing to a full novel, just kind of seeing if you liked that genre.

Samantha Sova: A book tasting is the chance for students to get to experience multiple genres in one block. We put them in groups first because otherwise they’d want to chat with their friends.

Samantha Sova: Four, five, six.

Audrey: I saw lots of tables in a U shape, and they had different station numbers on them with different books for different genres.

Becca Isaac: On table two, we have realistic fiction and action and adventure.

Rebecca Webster: Ms. Isaac and I picked books that either we’ve read or have been highly recommended by students, and we try to find ones that are on lots of different levels.

Becca Isaac: So I’m going to set the timer now, and then when you hear the beeper, it’ll be time to get up and move to the next table.

Rebecca Webster: They have about five minutes at each table, and students learn how to preview the book and decide if it’s something that they would want to read.

Samantha Sova: They get to judge a book by its cover, which is always very, very exciting for them. So they’ll read the back cover, read the first few pages, decide if it has any interest in them at all, and if it doesn’t, it’s OK, you can put it to the side, pick another one.

Samantha Sova: So if you’re reading… it does sound so good. When the author came to visit, I read that, I picked that one because of the way she talked about it.

Rebecca Webster: Sometimes they’ll look at a book, and you can tell they’re like, oh, I don’t care. But then if we walk around and give a book talk about it, then they’ll stop and they’ll say, “Oh, maybe I should consider that.” Rebecca Webster: But I loved it.

Student: It’s good?

Rebecca Webster: Yeah, it’s really good. Because it’s more than just romance. It’s like revolution and lots of action, lots of things going on.

Student: Awesome. Thank you.

Audrey: About three minutes in, the librarians would tell us that we should write down our thoughts about a particular book, if we found one that was interesting, and keep it in mind in case we wanted to check it out.

Becca Isaac: All right, it’s time to move to your next table, please.

Rebecca Webster: We usually try to collaborate with our teachers. Ms. Sova brings her classes every two weeks, so we’ve gotten to know some of her students, so we can pick books with them in mind.

Student: Yeah, I’m reading that book.

Samantha Sova: Yeah, right, that sounds amazing.

Samantha Sova: They pulled a really good variety even within the genre. There was like graphic novels, there was verse novels. So some of our more reluctant readers were like, oh, I can read that. For their four years in high school, they’re going to get at least three or four books each semester that they have to read. But we want them to want to read. And if they like what they’re reading, they’ll actually do it.

Samantha: When I go to a library next time, I’m probably going to do the book tasting idea. Because most of the time, I would just pick books off of like the author that I liked. But now that I’m discovering different genres, it’s quite interesting.

Audrey: For me, reading seemed like a homework assignment. But now I have gained that strategy of looking for a new book that I find interesting.

Rebecca Webster: At the end, they are supposed to rank the books that they’ve written down.

Becca Isaac: Since you’re checking out a book today for class, you would obviously want to check out that book that you ranked number one.

Rebecca Webster: When they have the attitude like, you know, “I don’t want to do this,” but then they take the book, it’s always fun to see that happen. And then a lot of times, they’ll come back and say, “Hey, that book you gave me was really good. Can you help me find another one?” Then you start building that trust.

Audrey: They told me I could check out two.

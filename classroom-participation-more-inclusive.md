## Transcript

Narrator: An inclusive, equitable, and respectful classroom has room for all students to participate and thrive. But not everyone engages in the same way. How can teachers empower those who are reluctant to speak up in class, while avoiding unconscious bias when calling on learners? These simple strategies will help ensure that you’re building a community where everyone can be heard.

Narrator: All students have opinions, but some may be too shy to express them out loud. Try creating participation cards that give everyone a voice in the room. You can label the cards, “I agree,” “I disagree,” or “I don’t know.” When you ask a question, everyone can hold up a card. So even the shyest students know their ideas matter. And, you’ll get a quick sense of who needs more information before you move on. Some students are quick to answer questions, forming their ideas as they speak. Others like to process the material silently, then shape their responses. When posing questions to the class, give students five to 15 seconds to think through their answer before they speak.

Narrator: Research shows that when teachers provide more waiting time, it has positive impacts on learning. This strategy will stretch the understanding of the concepts while acknowledging the value of a thoughtful answer. For some learners, just raising their hands can provoke anxiety. Seeing another student’s hand shoot up right away often discourages the more reserved ones from sharing.

Narrator: Ask your students to show you a thumbs-up against their belly instead or thumbs-down if they don’t know the answer. It’s a simple way to encourage participation among both the extroverted and introverted students, and it gives everyone an entry point into the conversation. Despite its reputation for causing stress, research has shown that cold calling can actually boost the number of students who speak up significantly. But how can you make sure you’re being fair?

Narrator: One way is equity sticks. This simple and effective technique promotes inclusion through random selection. Write each student’s name on Popsicle sticks. Place them in a cup with their names hidden. Pull a stick and ask that student, “Do you want to share?” This ensures that every student has the same opportunity to be picked and seen. Strategies like these are essential for building a more thoughtful and engaged community of learners.

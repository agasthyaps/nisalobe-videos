## Transcript

[Narrator] Can flexible classrooms actually boost student achievement? Will this comfortable chair and this emoji pillow improve academic performance? Well, no. It’s not the furniture, but a study out of England looked at 27 schools, 153 classrooms, and 3,766 students across the country and concluded that flexible welcoming classrooms did raise test scores. In fact, classroom flexibility is about as important as air quality, light, or temperature in boosting academic outcomes. And taken together, flexibility and a student’s sense of ownership account for over a quarter of the academic benefit attributed to classroom design. So what’s happening? It turns out that flexible classrooms change teaching and learning habits. They are versatile, so they support a broader range of educational strategies and they’re modifiable too. So they can quickly be adapted to meet individual and group needs. That makes a big difference, because the research shows that using a mix of strategies to teach a lesson, direct instruction, group work, independent inquiry, drives deeper learning among students. So changing the furniture in your classroom will almost certainly have no impact at all. If you don’t change your teaching too.

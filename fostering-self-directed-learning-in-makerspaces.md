# Fostering Self-Directed Learning in Makerspaces

> When students have the freedom to tinker and explore, their curiosity leads to perseverance—and the mastery of technical tools and skills.

## Article

In a small, rural Kentucky town, school leaders at Eminence Independent Schools prioritized their spending to invest in a state-of-the-art makerspace called the EDhub, where students from all grade levels would have opportunities to spend time each week. The outcome went far beyond cool tools and technical training—it sparked student enthusiasm and built a culture of exploration. From button-making to 3D printing, laser cutting to video editing, students choose a tool they want to explore and earn a badge once they achieve mastery.

As a result of this interest-based approach, teachers have seen a lift in students leading their own learning beyond the EDhub. To learn more about how the school funded and built the EDhub, read “ A Small Town School Embraces a Big Vision .”

## Transcript

Student: How are we going to fit two people on a chair?

Student: Or we could have two people jumping and acting like they’re falling.

Kendra Waddell: We learn most when we’re playful, and when we maybe aren’t being measured. Here, kids are able to come in and explore, but that process doesn’t have the same pressure as other aspects of school do and should. And so I think that open-endedness makes it kind of magical. It’s really giving kids an opportunity to create something of their own choice.

Student: Yeah, I like it. Let me get you some scissors.

Kendra Waddell: Eminence exists in a very rural community. We have a higher number of students on free and reduced lunch than many people might suspect when they just walk in the front doors and see such a beautiful building, but many of our families live in poverty. But the leadership here has worked so hard to create a space that feels wealthy in knowledge and resources. Our makerspace has a ton of excellent tools and resources. They range from computer programming types of tools to physical making and prototyping types of things, like 3D printers and laser cutters. Students are able to earn badges when they demonstrate competency with one of those tools. Some of the tools have a pretty low ceiling, like learning to use the button maker. It doesn’t take hours and hours of time. That can be mastered rather quickly. Learning to use something like the 3D printer or the laser cutter is a more complex tool and takes a larger commitment.

Clara: The laser cutter, it can be used for individual projects that students want to do. Sometimes it can be used for projects that will benefit the whole school, like the boxes that we’re making now for the cake walk.

Kendra Waddell: They go through training in a myriad of ways. We sometimes do one-on-one training with individuals.

Kendra Waddell: Do you have it oriented the right way on the sublimation printer?

Joey: Yeah, I have it landscaped out like that.

Kendra Waddell: We offer after-school workshops once a month called micro-credential Mondays.

Zoe: I went to micro-credential Monday, and I came here, and they were doing button making, and I got to micro-credential button making.

Kendra Waddell: Many of those opportunities arise within their classrooms, within the curriculum itself where the teacher is designing a project.

Joey: It’s the mastery of certain technological devices. Like for this, in one of my teacher’s classes, I’m making a bunch of T-shirts that we’re going to sell at one of the football games.

Kendra Waddell: If they’ve gone through the process of learning something complex, I don’t think it’s as intimidating to take on a new thing that’s complex.

Zoe: I think it helps me learn more deeply because I get to kind of make it in my own way.

Charlie: You try and make a corner all fit together, and then you hit the wrong thing and they all mess up and you’ve got to redo that whole corner. So you’ve got to be patient.

Kendra Waddell: There’s a lot of power, and there’s a lot of self-worth that’s developed by creating something that other people look at and say, “Wow, that’s really cool,” and I think that most of the tools that we have are enabling kids to do that in a variety of formats and fashions and media, that might speak to them and their interests.

Alexa Sorden: As we continued getting ready for reopening this school year, one of the systems that we have in place is our school wellness form. We’ll be able to check on families weekly so that we can see how they are feeling health wise and also to see if there’s anything that they need support with. So I send this survey out every Friday via text message. The parents click the link and it opens on their phone so that it creates easy access for families. So on the form, parents will be asked, “How are you feeling?” They have the drop-down option of either saying, “I feel great!” or, “I’m not feeling too well…” or, “I tested positive.” And it’s the same for the child. And then for how we could help, “I’m okay. I don’t need any help at this time.” or “I need help with food supply, with COVID testing sites, or with mental help support.” The other option that families have is if they need additional tutoring support, we’re able now to match them with the organizations that are providing free tutoring online. So after our families have completed the Google form, I’m able to analyze the data. So here’s a form that parents completed this past spring. And once I click on responses, I’m immediately able to see a pie chart. I can see that over 90 percent of my families are feeling well. And after that, I can export that into an Excel sheet so that I could now narrow down my support. So, for example, if families are asking for information on a food pantry, I immediately contact our parent coordinator. Then, if parents need support with mental health services, our school counselor contacts the families via phone to assess the situation. I share all the information with our teachers. “I’m just letting you know so that you are aware of the services that your families requested.” You may not want to put a lot of pressure on wantingthis project completed this week. This family is currently going through a personal crisis, so please check on them a little bit more often, just to say hello. We just really become more empathetic. What families have shared with us is that it feels as if they have a voice and know that someone is checking on you every single week. So being able to constantly have this information gives us an opportunity to be more proactive about what’s happening in our school community and less reactive. We believe that we’re a community of one, and that includes, obviously, our families.

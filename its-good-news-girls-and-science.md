# It’s Good News on Girls and Science

> A recent meta-analysis of almost 80 studies finds that girls are making dramatic strides in imagining themselves as scientists—but there’s still work to do.

A 1970s-era study found that, when asked to draw a scientist, boys and girls drew males an astonishing 99.4 percent of the time. Looking at roughly 5,000 drawings collected between 1966 and 1977, researchers determined that “only 28 were of female scientists,” as Edutopia reported in “ 50 Years of Children Drawing Scientists .” But in the ensuing decades, according to a meta-analysis published in 2018 , that trend witnessed a dramatic reversal, driven by broad changes in our cultural expectations around gender and in the way we educate girls. Today, more than half of girls draw a woman when asked to draw a scientist.

Other data provided by the National Science Foundation confirms that these changes in perspective are driving real-world results: In 2015, women made up 48 percent of biological, agricultural, and environmental life scientists, up from 34 percent in 1993. Women in all science and engineering occupations increased more modestly, from 22.9 percent in 1993 to 28.4 percent in 2015. That’s all great news.

But other findings from the meta-analysis suggest that as girls age, and particularly as they reach their teenage years, they experience a sudden, unexplained loss of confidence in their abilities in math and science. Our video suggests some research-backed strategies that should keep young girls moving forward and claiming their rightful place in STEM fields.

## Transcript

Narrator: The news is mostly positive. After a 1970s-era study found that kids draw scientists as males an astonishing 99.4 percent of the time, the trend has seen a dramatic reversal. In new research that looked at almost 80 studies over the ensuing decades, the number of kids who drew female scientists steadily increased. That change took place mostly among girls, so that by 1985 the number of girls who drew female scientists had risen from one percent to thirty-three percent. By 2015, it had jumped to fifty-eight percent! Those numbers tell us we’ve reached a safer, wider place for girls who dream. That’s a big deal. Still, that’s where the good news for girls ends, or at least gets a lot murkier. While the youngest girls think expansively, middle and high school girls experience a mysterious contraction of their expectations. The study revealed that while 70 percent of six-year-old girls draw a female scientist, only 25 percent of 16-year-old girls do. It’s baffling. And upsetting. There’s more work to do, obviously, and the research provides some direction. Several recent studies show that simple gestures of inclusion, such as classroom posters and books featuring diverse female STEM figures and inviting diverse female scientists into your classrooms as role models, can create a lasting impression of scientific competency in girls. And words matter, too, perhaps more than you’d like to admit. Research shows that language that paints science as a male domain by referring to boys as future scientists and girls as future women scientists, for example, can steer young girls away from the discipline. Finally, our approach to teaching math and science might be less appealing to girls. Ask a girl if she wasn’t to be an engineer and she’s ambivalent, according to a recent study. But ask if she wants to design irrigation systems to bring water to villages in need, and she’s all in.

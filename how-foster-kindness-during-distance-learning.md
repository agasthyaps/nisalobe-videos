Narrator: Random acts of kindness are wonderful, but practicing intentional kindness is a lot more predictable. If done consistently, it can flourish among students, bringing a sense of belonging, safety and a connection to your classroom, and laying the foundation for good academic work. But how do you do it during distance learning? Research shows that students who see their teacher as caring come to school more, are more engaged, and perform better academically. Simple gestures like welcoming students by name during daily calls can help everyone feel seen. Because nuances are easily lost when communicating virtually, don’t forget to be expressive with intentions and emotions. Replace greetings at the classroom door with gestures like air high fives and air hugs, or even simply a big smile to open and end class. Build an empathetic, caring community by sharing stories and checking in about what’s going on in students’ lives. Have them exchange fun details about their interests outside of school, or bring in loved ones for the whole class to interview. Make room for gratitude. Using digital tools like Google Classroom, Padlet or Jamboard, ask students to write down notes of appreciation for one another. You can even use everyday challenges, like the inevitable technical issues, as an opportunity to foster gratitude. Give students a shout-out when they share a missing link in chat, or take the time to check in with an offline peer. Virtual communities require commitment and kindness, just like in-person ones. It’s simple efforts like these that will ensure that everyone feels like a valued part of your online classroom.

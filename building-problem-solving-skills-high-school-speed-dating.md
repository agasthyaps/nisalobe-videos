When English language arts teacher Cathleen Beachboard was trying to come up with new ways of encouraging her students at Fauquier High School in Warrenton, Virginia, to be solution-oriented, she noticed that while kids often get stuck on their own problems, they are quick to find solutions to other people’s. Her husband jokingly said, ”Wouldn’t it be cool if you could just speed-date problems?” And the problem speed-dating activity was born. Beachboard has used this quick and simple strategy in her classes ever since.

“Today we were working on argumentative writing. But you could use this in any scenario, in any classroom, for any stuck point that the kids are having with any piece of content,” she says. In addition to hearing multiple ideas for solutions to their problems, kids get to know each other—and learn to see each other as experts in the room.

“Problem speed dating ultimately teaches them that as a society or as a person, you’re not alone,” Beachboard says. “And reaching out to others is important because that’s where the magic happens. It happens when we use each other and we use the strength that every person has.” Learn more about Beachboard’s teaching strategies from her posts for Edutopia , or check out her book, The School of Hope .

## Transcript

Cathleen Beachboard: Sometimes we get stuck when we get a lot of feedback and we don’t know how to address it, right? The smartest person in this room is not me. Who is it? The room. So we’re going to be doing some problem speed dating.

Cathleen Beachboard: When we do problem speed dating in my class, students are learning the power of collaboration and action. We feel like we’re stuck, but the reality is we can quickly find solutions to our problems when we use each other and the strength that every person has.

Student: Like thinking about your sentences before you write them down. Brainstorm about them. Those would be my biggest suggestions.

Cathleen Beachboard: So often in school we concentrate on deficits. Kids see, oh, I’m not good at math. They look at what they’re not good at. I want kids to realize they have their own personal strength and that’s the purpose of school. It’s to help you find what you are good at.

Cathleen Beachboard: Hey guys, good morning. Make sure you go in and grab your journal. Now I want you to look for a problem or a stuck point you’re having. It can be from a previous essay. It can be from your journal. Find something you’re struggling with.

Cathleen Beachboard: So the activity we did in class today was problem speed dating. The students are currently concentrating on expressing themselves through the argumentative essay. So they went through their journal where they have multiple pieces of feedback and they look for trends to figure out a problem that’s coming up over and over again, and from there they wrote down that problem on a sheet of paper.

Melvin: I wrote down that I had a problem with my word selection. Like I feel like I repeat words too much.

Cathleen Beachboard: So here’s what we’re going to do. You’re going to take your problems and I need you to stand across from a partner. You’re going to line up.

Hunter: We paired up and then we’d get 30 seconds to tell the other person what our problem was, and then they’d give us advice they’d have to fix that.

Student: My problem is grammar and word choice.

Student: What I find helps me is that I read it out loud like as if I’m talking to someone. It really helps to find fragmented sentences, run-ons.

Melvin: They give you solutions. You write them down and then you switch, they tell you their problem and you give them solutions. Then after that, you move down the line and you get a new partner.

Cathleen Beachboard: Ready, set, move.

Melvin: And you just do the same thing.

Hunter: I feel like I don’t always have three good reasons to support my point. It’s better to have feedback from different people versus just one because every person is different.

Cathleen Beachboard: I make sure that the students end up with at least three to four solutions in order to have this activity be completely effective.

Melvin: I got a lot of solutions. Use a thesaurus. Use synonyms and also ask people around you to read your writing because they can tell better than you that you’re repeating words too much.

Cathleen Beachboard: If you have one dart and you throw it at a dartboard, are you going to hit it? You’re probably not. But if you take dart after dart, and you keep throwing them because you have more darts, are you more likely to hit the target? Yes. How many of you now have solutions to your problem? Raise your hand. This is how powerful it is when we utilize each other. You’re going to go back to your seat. I want you to come up with a plan of action.

Cathleen Beachboard: So the plans of actions are going to be put into effect when they have their next essay next week. I actually have an entire booklet for each student of every plan of action they have. It’s like a portfolio of their learning, and it’s a great way for them to review before they start writing.

Melvin: It was very helpful to have the plan of action when I did my essay last week. Helps my essays make sense more. I think that the self-awareness you get from this exercise is very beneficial. You can listen to other people’s problems so you don’t make the same mistakes.

Cathleen Beachboard: I want to show the students that their expertise is needed in the conversation of learning. Ultimately, they become the teachers in the room, which also gives them confidence to use their strengths out in the world.

# Teaching Writing Through Landscape Paintings

> When students focus on what they can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell in a work of art, their imaginations—and their essay-writing skills—take flight.

## Article

Using landscape paintings, teacher Lori Brenneise turns essay writing into a fun activity. Every day, students build on their essays, guided by the five senses. Brenneise has used this activity across all grade levels.

She describes it as an excellent way to introduce second and third graders to organizing their writing in paragraphs. She has also used it with middle- and high school students to encourage descriptive writing, and with English language learners as well—it helps “grow their vocabulary because it gives them reason to learn new words and helps them overcome their fear of writing in a second language.” Many large museums have landscapes and cityscapes available online. Or better yet, partner with a local art gallery to highlight regional artists.

You can read more about Brenneise’s exercise in her article for Edutopia, “ How to Use Images to Teach Creative Writing .”

## Transcript

Lori Brenneise: Every year I do an exercise with my kids that helps their essay-writing skills and their creativity. They call it, “Painting with Words.” This is the first step to building better writers, because if a student dreads every time they have to write, then they are always going to struggle. But if the see it as something fun, they can’t wait to get started. This exercise takes about one week to do. I organize it by using the five senses. On the first day of the project I pass out artwork randomly. Each student gets one landscape painting. I have them write, “What I can see in the painting.” Usually, this starts out with very simple sentences. I ask the students to describe in a little more detail. Once they get the idea of using simple adjectives, this is where I bring in similes and metaphors. I don’t correct student sentences at this point, because I want to encourage their creativity. If the sentence is awkward but descriptive, go with it. The prompt for day two is “What I can hear in the painting.” Now, at this point, they will look at you like you have lost your mind. I have them close their eyes. I ask them to imagine what you would hear as you look around your painting. Then I do the same thing as the day before. I start having them grow the sentences and describe in a little more detail. Day three I tell them to start moving around the painting in their mind. We write, “What I can touch.” On day three, I very rarely have to talk to them about growing their sentences. Their minds and their imaginations are running wild. The prompt for day four is “What I can taste and smell in the painting.” I found it works better to combine the senses of taste and smell, because they are so closely related. On day five this will be the final draft, one paragraph for each of their senses, and they don’t have to use everything they wrote down, only what they feel is the best. I used the students’ essays to create a book. It makes them feel like real authors, because they are published. It builds their confidence as writers and now they cannot wait for the next writing assignment.

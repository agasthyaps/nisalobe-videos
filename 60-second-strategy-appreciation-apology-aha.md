## Transcript

Teacher: It’s appreciation, apology or aha. The closing circle activity is called the three As. Appreciation, apologies and ahas. The whole purpose is just to have some space to reflect on our day. All I want you to do is stand around the room somewhere in a circle, while we do our brief shout out. People can either identify an appreciation they have, an apology they have, or an aha, a moment where there’s like a light bulb moment in their head. My aha was that race is not the only part of our identity. So can we get a few people to shout out an appreciation, apology or aha.

Student: I want to appreciate Jonathan. He helped me kind of figure out where I wanted to go with my personal statement. I think those types of appreciations, or like, community recognitions can go a long way to build the bonds. That’s the whole point, right, building community.

Student: I apologize for having my headphones in half of the time, to everyone.

Teacher: Thanks a lot for that, Carlos, that means a lot.

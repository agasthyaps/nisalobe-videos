## Article

Valor Collegiate Academies’ Compass model—a social and emotional learning framework—has helped students make academic gains, so Valor is sharing it with educators from around the country. Valor makes all of the Compass model curriculum materials available as open source. This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Valor Collegiate Academies .

## Transcript

Daren Dickson: There is a growing movement of people that are really interested in recontextualizing education in our country with social and emotional and academic development. Some of the core elements that we have here at Valor are practices that push and develop all of us to grow. So Compass Camp is an evolution of Valor’s goal to really share the work that we’re doing.

Sarah Giblin: At Valor, we focus on a social emotional learning program that gives our kids the necessary character strengths. We use a model called the Compass. The Compass has different dimensions: sharp mind, big heart, noble purpose, and aligned actions. Essentially, we are working to develop all of those dimensions in our kids and in our adults.

Daren Dickson: It starts with the basic understanding that we all as humans have a lot of social and emotional growth to do. By doing a lot of this work, we believe that that’s gonna drive them to incredible academic success.

Teacher: Hi, welcome.

Teacher: Hi, how are you?

Daren Dickson: So Compass Camp is an opportunity to share the work that we’re doing.

Ezzie Smith: Today I’m in Tennessee to learn a lot more about social emotional learning. The activation and the full implementation of circles with adults and kids alike.

Melissa Eaton: This year, we got some feedback where students really felt like they didn’t build relationships with their teachers as much. And so we had come here today to think about how we could restructure our advisory program.

Daren Dickson: So our Valor Compass is our primary guiding metaphor. Today we have leaders from 14 different school networks across the country and we are going to introduce them to our Compass framework, our phase work, and our circle process with the hope that we can spread the practice in a meaningful way. So we chose the metaphor of the compass because we really liked the concept that it’s a way of finding your way in the world. Our participants get a brief overview of our model. In what we call compass discipline. Working the compass really means pursuit of excellence in every dimension. That’s something we hold ourselves to, that’s something to hold our kids to.

Teacher: Naye, would you tell us a little bit about your business?

Naye: Yeah Daren Dickson: And then, we have them observe one of our faculty circles.

Teacher: I just wanna appreciate you for the work that you do, oftentimes behind the scenes.

Daren Dickson: So they feel the emotional vulnerability that’s required and the level of trust and the types of relationships that have developed here as a result of that practice. In your packet, we actually want you to do some circle phase work. We then send them home with the type of phase work that both our scholars do and our adults do.

Melissa Eaton: And so in the packets, there’s reflections and guided questions.

Daren Dickson: One example is an exercise called If You Really Knew Me. That’s a sentence starter and you’re really gonna fill in as much as you’re comfortable sharing who you are with the circle. In the morning, we tour scholar circles. So they observe boys circle and a girls circle.

Student: I wanna appreciate you because you show a lot of kindness and you have a really big heart.

Daren Dickson: And then they officially participate in a circle themselves.

Teacher: Just take a few moments to concentrate and connect with your breath.

Daren Dickson: Every circle will start with a mindfulness-based practice for everybody in the circle to really focus their attention. And then it moves into a check-in.

Teacher: So I’m gonna ask you to think of one feeling word.

Daren Dickson: Which is a ritualized process. We’re getting everybody’s voice in the room.

Teacher: I’m feeling elated.

Teacher: I’m feeling grateful today.

Teacher: I’m feeling relaxed.

Daren Dickson: And then some brave souls will do some work in the circle and get to experience it firsthand.

Teacher: Ezzie, what are you proud of?

Ezzie Smith: Circle today was a little bit intimidating. I’m proud of the type of work that I do with kids. I participated in the exercise called A Thousand Questions. I’m proud of my two little girls. No matter how much time it took you, you are on the spot and you needed to think of what you were proud of. It really made you dig deep, and it was a cool experience to think about what I was proud of.

Teacher: So we’ll move into appreciations next. This is one of the final parts of circle.

Daren Dickson: And then we always end with appreciations.

Teacher: I really appreciate the work that you do.

Teacher: I appreciated your words of gratitude.

Teacher: I really appreciate your energy and the positive vibes that you gave to me today.

Teacher: You’re very kind.

Ezzie Smith: I’m definitely hoping to bring back, “Here’s a structure for how to do a great circle. What will it do for our kids overall?” Melissa Eaton: After learning about circles and learning about the program, I strongly believe that it will provide that sense of community that we’re looking for and allow students to have a really positive, deep relationship with an adult in the school.

Daren Dickson: I’m deeply grateful and humbled that you all came from all over the country to be here. I think my biggest hope is that people recognize the value of relationships and growth. This needs to start with us, the adults in the building. Then we as a country actually need to be relating with each other in different ways if we want to lead our kids.

# Activating Prior Knowledge With Hexagonal Thinking

> By creating a visual web of knowledge, students can demonstrate what connections they have already made about a topic.

## Article

At Monocacy Middle School in Frederick, Maryland, students in Allison Marsh’s 8th grade English language arts class are preparing to analyze informational articles about technology and social media. In order to help her students be successful in the task, Marsh first wants them to connect their prior knowledge to new content so they can properly engage with the big essential question of the unit: “How do the challenges you face today shape your future?” To make these connections visible, Marsh uses an activity called hexagonal thinking . Students get into groups of four with one set of hexagon-shaped cards per group.

Today, they were given a starting card with the the topic of social media on it. Additional cards containing key terms from the text—parent concern, technology, and addiction, for example—were dealt out. Each student has an opportunity to match the edge of one of their cards to the starting card in the center of the table.

Students may also link to cards other students have put down, or even match up two edges at once, ultimately creating a web of related terms that represents their thinking. As they place each card, they offer a rationale for why they see a connection. Explains Marsh, “You can’t just look at a kid and know how they think or what they understand about something.

So we have to be explicit using strategies to glean what they already know and what they can bring to the activity.” Learning Science Partners ’ Jim Heal describes why this activity is so effective. “ Schema is a term that describes the way that we organize information in our minds,” he explains. “As students learn a new topic, they move away from thinking of ideas as isolated facts and instead consider them in relationship to one another.” By asking students to participate in the hexagonal thinking activity, the teacher is able to make the students’ interconnected networks of ideas explicit.

And when the ideas are literally laid out on the table, the teacher also has a chance to push for further rationalization, which makes connections stronger, and lets her address any misconceptions before students engage in the analysis.

## Transcript

Allison Marsh: Yesterday we talked about social media and the effects that… Dr.

Jim Heal: Schema is a term that describes the way that we organize information in our minds. As students learn a new topic, they move away from thinking of ideas as isolated facts, and instead consider them in relationship to one another. When we work with students, one of the most important things we can do is to invite them to make that schema, those interconnected networks of ideas, more explicit and to sometimes literally lay them out on the table.

Allison Marsh: Today, we are focusing on the following questions. You can’t just look at a kid and know how they think are what they understand about something, so we have to be explicit using strategies to gain what they already know what they can bring to the activity. Do you guys remember how you’re going to use the hexagonal cards today?

Student: Well, you have a topic and then we deal out the cards and we basically connect ideas to the main topic.

Allison Marsh: The overall objective of this unit is for them to analyze informational articles about technology and social media.

Student: We will connect prior knowledge to new knowledge. How? By engaging in hexagonal thinking.

Allison Marsh: Today, they were given a topic of social media with the terms that were pertinent to the text. One student deals out the cards, and then they each had a chance to make a connection.

Student: Parent concerns because the parents could be concerned that their kid is not doing anything else but being on the social… Allison Marsh: Then the next person who comes in has to make a connection with either one of the hexagonal shapes, or they can connect it with two of those shapes, so they have to explain how they made those two connections.

Student: Social media and technology could affect someone’s beliefs.

Allison Marsh: This activity helped to activate students’ prior knowledge in order to engage in the big idea of this unit.

Student: A lot of teenagers are influenced by social media, like what they wear, how they eat, how they act.

Allison Marsh: I’m having them record this information, so I’m able to review and then follow through with any misconceptions that they might’ve had.

Student: Because if you use social media on technology, you can become obsessed.

Dr.

Jim Heal: So when this teacher invites her students to engage in the hexagonal thinking task, she’s in fact asking them to physically represent the schema that they currently hold. By asking them to share that thinking with others, they’re having to rationalize why they placed an item of information where they did, and also how that relates to other things that they know. In cognitive science terms, this is literally inviting them to make schema explicit, that’s what it is.

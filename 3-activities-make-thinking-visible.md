Teacher: It’s easy to grade for the right answers but how do you know when your students are really getting it? It’s not always obvious how they arrived at their conclusion. But the right activity can give you a window into your students’ brains to see their thinking process and find out what they really know and what needs further reinforcement.

Visible Learning: Vertical learning is a group activity where students showcase their thinking on a white board, a black board or a window. The vertical surface is key for engagement and allows you to follow their process as it happens. Start by providing a rich task, something that does not have only one answer. Divide students into groups of four and assign each person a role. The scribe writes what the group is thinking. The speaker represents the group to the whole class. The inquirer is the only one who can ask you questions and a manager makes sure the group is staying on track. While students work, observe how they collaborate, see whether they are on task and answer any questions they have. After 20 minutes, have each group present. Because all the work is public, everyone can see each other’s process, the choices they made and how they got there and mistakes simply become part of the learning.

Visible Learning: A fish bowl is a powerful collaborative learning activity where a small group of students has a focused discussion while the rest of the class sits around them observing and listening. Students on the outside learn discussion norms and make their own connections while the inner ring gains a deeper understanding of the topic. You can assess students’ grasp on the material by noting what they bring up, what textural evidence they use and what questions they have for each other. Prepare by asking students to read a few articles or respond to prompts based on your current unit book or theme. On the day of the fish bowl, provide questions that students will debate based on their readings or give students a goal like coming up with an opinion on a controversial topic. By the end of the activity, you should have a clear sense of who gets it and who may need a bit more help.

Visible Learning: It’s particularly tough to get students to explain their thinking in math when temptation is strong to just give the right answer. This activity asks students to justify their choices in using certain mathematical methods. First, students circle the question on the worksheet and write an “I have to” statement like, “I have to find out who made the most points in each round.” Then have each student write down the strategy they’ll use to solve the problem like, “I will use addition,” or, “I will multiply.” Next have students solve the problem then write their answer in a complete sentence. Finally, ask them to write out how they solved the problem using at least two math words and make connections to previous math they’ve learned. Curating a problem solving plan helps students see the path to their answer and makes their thinking visible right on the paper. All you need to do is pick it up to see their level of understanding and knowledge.

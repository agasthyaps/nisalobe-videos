## Article

In rural central California, newcomer teacher Efraín Tovar connects language learning with computer science through an app-development project where his multilingual middle school students learn how to code—in tandem with learning English. This practice of encouraging recent immigrant students with limited English proficiency to engage with technology gives them a chance to demonstrate their fluency in creative ways. The students use a range of tools in their classroom, such as Lightbot.com for entry-level programming puzzles, Code.org for free CS curriculum resources, and MIT App Inventor for student-friendly app-development projects.

To dig into the research on coding and language learning, check out these resources: Shahira Popat and Louise Starkey’s systematic review of articles about educational outcomes for children learning how to code at school (2019) Scott R.

## Transcript

Efraín Tovar: I want you to look at lesson number one. Can you tell us what the angry bird has to do? Student 1: He’s not <inaudible>. Efraín Tovar: You’re right. Count with me. One, two. Efraín Tovar: Because we leverage future-ready skills like computer science and multiliteracy, our newcomers are becoming effective communicators, collaborators, critical thinkers, and, most of all, problem solvers. Efraín Tovar: We have approximately 10 primary languages that are spoken within the community of Selma. About one out of every four students has been in our language development classes. So, very diverse. Efraín Tovar: Today we’re going to be working on our computers. You’re going to open your iPad, and you’re going to turn on your Wi-Fi. Efraín Tovar: We’re primarily an ag-based community, and so with that, many of our students have not had those opportunities with technology like other students throughout California. I want my students to have creative opportunities to demonstrate their language proficiency. Efraín Tovar: Why can’t we marry computer science and language development? Efraín Tovar: And then start with number one. Efraín Tovar: Every year the students create an app, but in order for them to do the app, we have to build the foundational skills. And so we use an app called Lightbot. That Lightbot is a simple, kid-friendly, critical thinking app that allows them to accomplish certain tasks. As they progress through the different lessons, it becomes a lot more rigorous. Efraín Tovar: Then from there, we transition them into an online curriculum via Code.org. Efraín Tovar: So you can provide the content but still have that language development right underneath. Efraín Tovar: And then the next phase, we use App Inventor, by MIT, which really allows students to create an Android-based app.

Maria: The application that we’re making, it helps us to read and think critically to solve problems. Efraín Tovar: What kind of app are they going to be creating?

App Voice: Classroom. Efraín Tovar: They’re creating an app that has to do with language development.

Maria: It can show those who are just starting out how they can, in the application, read, write, listen, or speak. Efraín Tovar: We are truly equipping our newcomers for tomorrow’s world. To be able to create something and to share a passion project goes a long way. And it also engages students. When there’s buy-in and you’re allowed some freedom and especially to be creative, students get excited about the learning process. Efraín Tovar: Guys, good job today. Let’s put our stuff away.

## Article

Mindy Sizemore is an art teacher at Spring Mills High School in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Inspired to build on the strong tradition of fiber arts in West Virginia, she introduced her students to knitting. As they used cardboard looms to create friendship bracelets, Sizemore noticed something unexpected.

With both hands occupied, engaged in a purposeful but repetitive action, her students couldn’t use their cell phones. More than that, they relaxed, opened up, and began talking easily with their classmates. For a generation where high school students are sometimes more comfortable with digital interaction than face-to-face conversation, Sizemore saw this as an opportunity to practice communication skills in a low-stakes way.

So Sizemore decided to build on her sit-and-stitch activity by adding an interview component. Now, she provides a list of questions to pairs or trios of students. Once they’ve gotten the hang of knitting using their cardboard looms, the students take turns asking each other the listed questions.

For this class period, Sizemore chose to focus her questions on heroes, scaffolding the questions to ease the students into more vulnerable topics. Early questions ask about favorite superheroes, while later questions ask for personal reflections about a real-life hero. The groups continue to knit while they listen to and answer questions, giving them a place to focus their energy and generating a low-stress format for conversation.

Any kind of repetitive artistic or craft activity would be effective. Having the structure of prewritten questions also takes pressure off. “We think of teenagers as very stoic or closed off,” notes Sizemore.

“So they always surprise me that they’re very open, and some of their answers are really touching.” Stepping away from their phones, they offer thoughtful reflections and get to know their classmates. Students further advance their conversational skills by taking the project home. They teach a family member how to make their own cardboard loom.

Once they’re both knitting, the student interviews the family member with the same hero-themed questions and records the audio. They learn more about each other, bond over a shared activity, and create matching friendship bracelets as a lasting reminder. With the skills they gain in their knitting interviews, the teens build confidence and greater readiness for face-to-face conversations—skills that will serve them well in future settings, from everyday conversations to job interviews.

## Transcript

Student: Can you think of anyone you would consider an everyday hero to you?

Student: Ooh, definitely my mom.

Mindy Sizemore: Because we do knitting interviews, students have meaningful conversations. They’re able to connect with a classmate, and knitting keeps kids’ hands busy while they activate their brain.

Student: What makes this person a hero in your eyes?

Student: Because she helps people that need help more than she does.

Student: Sure, that’s sweet.

Mindy Sizemore: For me, trying to make school a joyful and fun place and giving kids an environment that they really feel that they can be themselves is so important. Here in Appalachia, particularly in West Virginia, lots of people have a fiber arts practice. You want to keep that going and make kids feel that the things they’re seeing at home are art and worthy of exploring. So, I teach them how to knit with the cardboard loom. First, they choose seven different colors of yarn and make a cardboard loom. It’s a braid, essentially. It’s very simple for students to learn. 1, 2, 3. Third one goes to the empty and then spin it so the empty’s facing you. Your bracelet is going to come through the middle right there. After they’ve started making their bracelets, they interview each other, have a list of interview questions that they go through. So, I kind of build the vulnerability into the questions. I try and warm them up with some sillier questions like, who’s your favorite superhero?

Student: What superhero do you think your mom is most like?

Student: I think Superman because she just flies. She could just teleport out anywhere. She’s there.

Student: Also, she got powers.

Student: Yes, my mom has superpowers, whether they’re real or not.

Mindy Sizemore: Having something to do with your hands relaxes people and takes the pressure off. I love it because when they are doing that, they can’t have their cell phone in their hand, so it’s really good to keep them focused.

Remaliah: It was like making more connected to the person you’re interviewing and make the process a bit less stressful. You can make a new friend in the process.

Mindy Sizemore: I think we think of teenagers as very stoic, they’re closed off. So, it always surprises me how open kids are willing to be with each other when they start talking about who is a personal hero or how could you pay it forward?

Student: What are the smaller, everyday acts of courage that you believe are important?

Student: Some people will try to hide who they really are to try to fit in. But if some people don’t like you based on how you really are, they’re just not your friends. You just have to be yourself.

Student: Yeah.

Mindy Sizemore: Having an interview format is really valuable. They have structure. This is how you’re going to ask questions, this is what you’re going to answer. So, it takes a little bit of that social weight off of them. It’s a helpful tool for any kind of interview that kids are going into. So, at the high school level, I think it’s a really neat skill to build and a fun way to build it. And you should have a complete little braid. Tug it tight. Ta-da. Thank you.

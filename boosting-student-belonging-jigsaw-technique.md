## Article

The “jigsaw classroom” is a cooperative learning approach originally designed by psychologist Elliot Aronson to build up empathy in recently desegregated classrooms. In the jigsaw system , each student receives one small part of a bigger lesson—then, in small groups, students have to pool their knowledge together and teach each other what they learned. “Aronson compared it to gift-giving,” says social psychologist Geoffrey Cohen.

“When I give a gift, I feel a sense of attachment to the person I’m giving it to—and vice versa.” Cohen walks us through the classic jigsaw research from the 1970s and lays out how the strategy can help the modern-day teacher looking to boost empathy, collaboration, and a sense of belonging in their classroom. To learn more from Daniel Leonard’s interview with Cohen for Edutopia, read “ The Science of Belonging and Connection .” To read the original research, along with several newer studies on the approach, check out the links below: Elliot Aronson and Diane Bridgeman’s seminal research on using jigsaw lessons to reduce prejudice in recently desegregated classrooms (1979) Iain Walker and Mary Crogan’s study on the jigsaw classroom’s effects on academic performance and prejudice (1998) Soohyun Nam Liao, William G. Griswold, and Leo Porter’s article on the social and academic benefits of jigsaw lessons (2018) Jean Twenge et al.’s study on the worldwide increases in adolescent loneliness (2021)

## Transcript

Narrator: A sense of belonging is really critical for success in school. That sense that we are part of a larger whole, that there is a fit between me and my environment. But the data does suggest that students’ sense of connection at all grade levels is on the decline internationally. There are pedagogical practices that convey to students, you belong here, and jigsaw is a brilliant example of that. Jigsaw classroom is classic research by Elliot Aronson that’s inspired so much of the cooperative learning movement in U.S. education, and they found this to be very effective at reducing prejudice and improving the performance of minority students in the aftermath of desegregation. Basically what you’re doing is you’re creating a collaborative situation where it’s in people’s self-interest to treat each other nicely and to cooperate. And so what he did was to create these small learning groups, five to seven kids working together, and each individual gets a separate piece of the lesson plan. So if you’re studying American history, one kid would get the original settlers, another kid would get something later in American history, like the ’60s. Each kid, under the guidance of the teacher, becomes an expert in their little piece of the puzzle. And so each kid is kind of like a jigsaw piece, and it’s only by pooling our information and sharing it that we can learn the whole lesson in its entirety. The brilliance of this is that there’s so many positive outcomes. It’s in the kid’s interest to cooperate, it encourages kids to talk and get to know one another better, it fosters equal status. Another benefit is subjective, psychological. I learned that, hey, if I’m struggling on this work, it’s like other people are often struggling too, so I don’t take it as personally. There’s social proof that it’s the difficulty of the work and not something about me and my belongingness that explains my difficulty. I think what a lot of teachers, including myself, can get wrong is you can’t just put people together into groups and say, go to it. Group learning, when it’s structured appropriately, can make a world of a difference to those people who feel themselves to be or are seen as outsiders. If you can kind of bolster people at that key moment where they’re trying to get a foothold, it can be a catalyst for health and achievement and growth.

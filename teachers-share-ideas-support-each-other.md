## Article

Many teachers feel stuck figuring out ways to overcome issues in classrooms all by themselves, which can be isolating and frustrating. But with some intentional effort and time dedicated to collaboration with fellow educators, teachers can build a stronger community of support—and walk away with new strategies for handling their own classes. From professional growth partners who help each other refine teaching practices, to teacher teams that meet regularly to work together to navigate difficulties and review ideas, to learning walks that allow a peek into a colleague’s classroom, sometimes the answers can be found right next door.

## Transcript

Narrator: Sometimes, figuring out ways to overcome challenges in your classroom can feel like a lonely journey. But you don’t have to go it alone when faced with difficulties. Whether you’re wrestling with behavior issues or barriers to learning, the answer might be found right next door. Here are three ways teachers can learn from each other and discover solutions to classroom problems together. Spending intentional time with colleagues who have classes, approaches, or subjects that are similar to yours can be highly beneficial. Find a professional learning partner to regularly check in with. Make time to swap ideas, discuss issues, and brainstorm solutions to challenges one or both of you may be working through. Frequent opportunities to compare and contrast experiences not only build community between you and your fellow teachers, but can help you bring fresh energy into your lessons. Getting educators with different points of view into the same room on a regular basis can be a valuable way to foster professional growth. Gather in a small group setting once or twice per semester with the sole intent of reflecting and sharing what is working or not working in your classes. This open-ended brainstorming session with other teachers in your school could help you and your students get unstuck. Even though it takes more effort to organize, one particularly effective way to glean useful practices from your peers is by seeing them in action. If your school leadership supports it, go on a learning walk in a small team. Use a prep period to sit in on others’ lessons for short stints of time. If you can, establish an open-door policy with your colleagues. Be sure to come up with some guidelines to ensure the least amount of disruption possible. Observing other teachers with a focus on learning from one another rather than evaluation can give you a fresh perspective in leading your own classes. Navigating the ups and downs of teaching doesn’t have to be done on an island. Setting aside the space and time to collaborate and problem-solve with fellow educators can be a game-changer.

## Article

At Barbara Morgan STEM Academy in Meridian, Idaho, celebrating academic progress is woven into the learning process from kindergarten through fifth grade. Whether students have reached a milestone or even taken an important step toward a goal, teachers take time to honor that growth publicly. By setting up these routines early in the year, teachers build a culture of ownership, pride, and shared responsibility to help all learners progress.

In Kait Hudson’s first-grade class, this often looks like a “celebration circle,” where students share achievements pertaining to a specific goal, reflect on their journey, and acknowledge both their own efforts and the success of their peers. Hudson believes these moments contribute to a supportive classroom where students develop characteristics like perseverance, empathy, and kindness. “I use circles to help kids celebrate themselves and each other on a goal that we’ve met—or progress towards our goal,” she says.

“It gets that knowledge mobility to just really be everywhere in the classroom.” The students gather in a circle and establish how they are celebrating—on this particular day it is with little clappers and an “Oh, yeah!” chant. Students have a chance to step into the circle to speak about where they are in their learning journey or note a classmate’s progress—but Hudson instructs them to be specific in order to keep the focus on the academic goal at hand. Not every celebration is about reaching the final goal.

Students are encouraged to recognize partial progress and set new intentions for where they want to go next. “Celebrating students that haven’t met the full goal but have met a piece just gives them more power in believing in themselves,” Hudson says. And if a student has met a milestone?

She likes to ask, “What are you doing to push yourself? Because learning is never done.” These regular, intentional moments of reflection help build motivation and excitement for academic progress—while reminding students that learning is a journey worth celebrating.

## Transcript

Student: I celebrate myself because I learn and be positive.

Class: Oh, yeah.

Kait Hudson: Because we celebrate learning as a class, my students have clarity in their learning and really respect that process of our learning journey. We want to celebrate these people for meeting their doubles goal. Can you give them a “Doubles doubles, yeah”?

Class: Doubles doubles, yeah.

Kait Hudson: Right.

Katie Mittleider: Celebrating learning is just something that’s really encouraged here in our building. And we do it starting at the kindergarten level all the way up to the fifth-grade level. We really want to make it something that students look forward to. Gives them a little bit of that ownership. They get to articulate what they need to feel supported to achieve goals, but they get excited about it because we make it fun.

Kait Hudson: I bet we have a lot to celebrate. So I want you to think of one thing you can celebrate in math. I use celebration circles to help kids celebrate themselves and each other on a goal that we’ve met or progress towards our goal. And it gets that knowledge mobility to just really be everywhere in the classroom. Our main targets say we can— Class: We can— Kait Hudson: —use friendly facts— Class: —use friendly facts— Kait Hudson: —to help us add and subtract.

Class: —to help us add and subtract.

Kait Hudson: Having a goal and really talking about what are all those pieces of that goal, so kind of that learning journey. And then just constantly reflecting on where they’re at in that goal. Does anyone have something they can celebrate? Sometimes it’s just celebrating a learner trait or a learner behavior.

Student: I celebrate myself by being quiet, not talking to others.

Kait Hudson: And then I want them to celebrate themselves.

Student: I earned a purple card.

Kait Hudson: What target have you met?

Student: Using doubles in your doubles.

Kait Hudson: Give him a “Doubles doubles, yeah.” Class: Doubles doubles, yeah.

Kait Hudson: Celebrating students that haven’t met the full goal but have met a piece just gives them more power in believing in themselves. You haven’t met your goal yet— Class: Yet.

Kait Hudson: But you’re still in the… what do you call the— Student: Pit.

Class: Pit.

Kait Hudson: The learning pit. Let’s give a “Learning pit, yeah.” Class: Learning pit, yeah.

Kait Hudson: And jump back out. And if you’ve met the goal, what are you doing to push yourself? Because learning is never done.

Katie Mittleider: That ownership of learning gets them excited about not just where they’re at, but also helping to excite their peers in their classroom and say, “Hey, as a group, we are able to achieve these great things.” Student: Celebrate Emily because— Student: Oh.

Class: Oh, oh, yeah.

Student: And she’s met every single goal that we have right now.

Kait Hudson: Oh, oh, yeah.

Class: Oh, oh, yeah.

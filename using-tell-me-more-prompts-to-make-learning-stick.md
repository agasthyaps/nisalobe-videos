## Article

At Sugarloaf Elementary School in Frederick, Maryland, kindergarten teacher Heather Van Eck does something intentional with her students to help make learning stick better during their math lesson on groups of 10—as she roams the room, instead of showing them what they did wrong or providing them the correct answer, she approaches their work with curiosity, prompting them with simple questions tailored to get them to explain their thinking—and often, arrive at a new understanding on their own. It’s one of the ways Van Eck injects more research-backed learning science into her daily classroom practice. By asking students to walk her through their thinking by saying, “Tell me more about how you did this,” she’s helping them cement the concepts she’s trying to teach.

As Jim Heal from Learning Science Partners explains, “Inviting students to rationalize why they arrived at an idea is a really powerful way to make that idea more memorable.” He emphasizes the importance of asking the right questions that push for deeper thinking, instead of those that can be answered yes or no. For teachers trying it out, Deans for Impact has published a resource called “ Prompting for Effortful Thinking ” that describes how to do this more effectively, shares why it works, and lists common pitfalls to avoid. “When I ask the right question,” says Van Eck, “I can really see the light bulb come on.” In this class, she noticed a student’s mistake and, instead of pointing it out, asked her to rationalize her thinking, which led to an aha moment for the kindergartner.

“I was like, ‘Tell me a little bit about this.’ And I could just see that she was able to then look at her own work without me correcting her right away.” Another way that questioning can be enormously helpful is to keep students at the site of thinking for longer, which in turn makes the learning stick. As Heal explains, “It’s overlooked as a very effective strategy simply to say, ‘Tell me more about that.’ Keeping students at the face of a concept longer—we know that’s likely to make that idea more reliably remembered for the future.” This video is part of our How Learning Happens series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Heather Van Eck: All right. Kindergarten, go for it. What do you know about teen numbers? Go for it.

Dr.

Jim Heal: Inviting students to rationalize why they came up with an idea is a really powerful way to make that idea more memorable, more sticky. You cannot ask students questions that simply rely on kind of yes/no answers or binary thinking. The whole idea about prompts and follow-up questions is that you need to be able to push for deeper understanding, for greater rationale. Show me what you mean.

Heather Van Eck: You have a variety of resources that you could use. When you go back to your seats, you’re going to show how can you show this number? I really wanted them to understand that in decomposing teen numbers, that there is a full 10 and extra ones. Mathematicians. I’m seeing friends use 10 frames. I’m seeing some friends use some tally marks. With my lesson, I started with a visual representation. And then from there, the students had a more concrete experience with hands-on math tools. And so tell me about this. What’d you do up here?

Student: I put in 5 and 5.

Heather Van Eck: OK.

Student: And then I put this 5 extra ones.

Heather Van Eck: And then the students were able to write an equation to match.

Student: 10 plus 5 equals 15.

Heather Van Eck: 10 plus 5 equals 15. Some of them really needed the questioning, so asking them, “How can we get there?” Heather Van Eck: Can you tell a little bit about that? What are these groups of… what?

Student: Tally marks.

Heather Van Eck: Tally marks. And how many are in this one?

Dr.

Jim Heal: What she was doing was not necessarily getting them to sort of regurgitate some procedural list of steps that they went through. She’s saying, “Talk me through your thinking and how you got there.” That does a great job of connecting their experience of what they engaged in while still giving them the invitation to rationalize.

Heather Van Eck: So you have a full 10, right? How many do you have over here? When I ask the right question, I can really see just the light bulbs come on. One of my students today, she was on the right track, but her equation just wasn’t matching her example that she used with her tool. And I just was like, “Tell me a little bit about this.” And I could just see that she was able to then look at her own work without me correcting her right away. You have some great thoughts here.

Student: 12. 12.

Heather Van Eck: I love how you self-corrected. Yeah. You used your math tool, right? And I’ve really tried to do a better job with asking them to look for their errors and their misconceptions before me telling them what they did.

Dr.

Jim Heal: I think it’s very overlooked as a very effective strategy simply to say, “So tell me more about that.” Heather Van Eck: What equation did you write?

Student: 10 plus 5 equals 15.

Dr.

Jim Heal: Oftentimes, you’ll get an answer and you think, “Great, that’s good enough.” Rather than saying, “Well, no, what else did you notice about that?” Heather Van Eck: Is that the only way you could write this equation?

Aarna: No, I have another way.

Heather Van Eck: What’s the other way, Aarna?

Aarna: 11 plus 4 equals 15.

Heather Van Eck: OK, that is another way. I love that.

Dr.

Jim Heal: Keeping students at the chalk face of that concept for longer, we know that that’s likely to make that idea more reliably remembered for the future.

## Article

At Amana Academy in Alpharetta, Georgia, every grade level from kindergarten through eight has a thematic focus that lasts the full school year and is integrated into each academic subject. In eighth grade, students investigate what it means to be a “changemaker” in their community by tackling real-world problems and studying how individuals throughout history have made a difference. From math to English language arts (ELA) to STEM, each class weaves the theme into their regular curriculum.

In ELA, for example, eighth graders read the book Farewell to Manzanar , a memoir about the experience of a young woman and her family in a Japanese internment camp in the U.S. during World War II. For the author, writing the book and talking about her family’s experience was her way to be a changemaker. In STEM class, students learned about the homeless population in Atlanta—first building empathy by reading stories of real people, and then helping to address the problem by partnering with a local nonprofit, the Mad Housers , to build a small home that would be given to a local family or individual in need.

By the time Amana students head for high school, all of them identify as changemakers, and they have the agency and confidence to make a difference—in their own lives and the lives of others.

## Transcript

Yerrison Cardenas: Eighth grade is the culminating year, where it all kind of boils down to you. Jean-Jacques Credi: Our students are empathizing and collaborating and generating solutions, and so there’s that real purpose behind it, because that’s how we’re going to solve the world’s problems, and that’s the kind of changemakers we want to create.

Yerrison Cardenas: The goal is for you to finish eighth grade in going, this is what I’m most passionate about. This is where I want to be the change. The mission at Amana is to create active contributors to a better world. We want to have students who are finding solutions to real-life problems, and so we do that through the expeditions. Jean-Jacques Credi: Learning expeditions are the hallmark of EL education schools. It is a thematic, integrated curriculum.

Mona Hussain: So you take a concept, and then you connect science, social studies, ELA, math, and bring them together. Think about this guiding question of the expedition and you being the changemaker. What is your big takeaway from the novel?

Amira: So the theme we’re working on in eighth grade is called “Changemakers.” We’re learning how to help our community.

Mikayla: Being a changemaker means making the world a better place and just adding your spice to the world. In ELA, we’re reading a book called Farewell to Manzanar .

Amira: It talks about Jean Wakatsuki and her personal experience at a Japanese internment camp.

Student: Everybody of Japanese descent, their rights were stripped away from them when the war started.

Mona Hussain: Jean has been a changemaker by writing the memoir, yeah?

Yerrison Cardenas: We want to make sure that they understand about the other changemakers in history and how they’re going to be changemakers.

Mona Hussain: You are writing this reflective narrative piece. How do people bring about change? What does it take to be the changemaker? Jean-Jacques Credi: So what our eighth graders are doing is really inspiring. They’ve been learning about homelessness, especially in the metro Atlanta area.

Yerrison Cardenas: So this isn’t new to us, correct? So what am I looking at?

Mikayla: OK, this is a website designed for showing homelessness and where people come from in their stories. The person I read about became homeless because when she moved to Atlanta, she lost her father and they put the home up for sale.

Yerrison Cardenas: What is it that stood out to you the most from their personal narratives that we’ve read?

Amira: Her life was going fine, and then out of nowhere she lost her job. A lot of people judge, but you never really know what they have gone through.

Yerrison Cardenas: And so that’s what we’ve been exploring, that’s what we’ve been doing. Why?

Mikayla: Because we’re building a homeless shelter.

Yerrison Cardenas: For all of our expeditions, we have a STEM product.

Mikayla: We use this thing called the design thinking process. We research the problem, and then we start thinking of solutions.

Yerrison Cardenas: We’ve been partnering with Matt Hauser, who focuses on building and providing shelters for people in the homeless community. Today I want you to pick out how many two-by-fours do I need? So the students have been building for three weeks now.

Amira: We were assigned the back panel, so we finished it. And now we’re doing the loft for storage above the house.

Yerrison Cardenas: So what are you going to do today?

Yerrison Cardenas: Let’s check. Line them up.

Mikayla: Building the house makes me feel good about myself, and it makes me feel like I’m giving back.

Amira: It’s a really fun activity because we see the background of it, like it’s not just for the grade, but we’re building it for the person in our community.

Yerrison Cardenas: I think this is one of the most important expeditions, the ones that make life-changing moments and memories. A lot of them go home and start telling their parents. Helping build a house is something that our students look forward to. Jean-Jacques Credi: What our students are seeing is that there are very complicated challenges in this world. We’re not going to solve them quickly and easily, but we can start making a difference, and we can make an impact on our community. And if that’s what they walk away with, that’s the outcome we’re looking for.

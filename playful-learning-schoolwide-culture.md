## Article

In Eminence, Kentucky, a small rural district has dedicated their entire school to reveling in the joy and excitement of learning. From makerspaces to interactive hallways to a slide that sends students from the top level to the ground, they have created a space that captures the imagination—and has become the pride of their economically challenged community. But the approach goes well beyond the physical building.

Teachers are supported in professional development sessions that encourage them to inject a sense of “surprise and delight” into their lessons, as well as in guiding students through meaningful projects that connect to their community. So school becomes a place where academic rigor is accomplished in an active, collaborative, and engaging way.

## Transcript

Thom Coffee: Kids are either going to run to school or from school, and so we want it to be a place where the first vibe when you walk in the door is, this is a fun place to be. If you’re going to sit in a class and there’s content that is state or federally mandated and you could learn that in a way that is exciting and hands-on or goes above and beyond your expectations, then why would we bring students a thousand times a day into a building and not include fun and engaging activities into the school day?

Larry Jesse: As a town, Eminence is small, probably about a mile and a half from one edge to the other. We’ve got a couple of pockets of neighborhoods, and then it turns rural very quickly. And socioeconomically, we’re at about 60 percent free and reduced lunch.

Thom Coffee: People who visit see a fantastic place that looks like Silicon Valley. You get these cool makerspaces and collaborative spaces, and all those things were intentional in the design, but it was really a way to have our facility match the philosophy that was already here. So the building that was established in 1901, it looked like a very traditional school, but you would see kids in hallways and groups doing projects, building, making, doing, creating. And so we did the addition; it was really about creating a space that met those needs.

Larry Jesse: We subscribe to an idea here called “surprise and delight.” We’re looking for ways every day to put a smile on the face of our staff, of our students, and to give them an excitement when they come to school each day. We have the space hallway in the elementary school where the floor looks like lava as they’re walking over the tiles. We say, “Why take the stairs when you can take the slide?” I think that adding a sense of whimsy and a sense of excitement and discovery is exactly what education is about.

Thom Coffee: But it’s really the people, it’s not the place, and that’s what I think makes this place special. Playful, creative, risk-taking, collaborating types of people. When you have a staff that embraces and embodies those things, it’s easy to then transfer that into the classroom. And so, if something you try flops, you have to celebrate the effort and the attempt, and you have to reflect on the process and keep going. And that’s what we want to model in our kids. They’re not always going to be successful.

Teacher: We’re so excited to have you down, guys. I’m excited for you to keep working on the micro-credential project.

Thom Coffee: Also, we’re on a mission here, and it’s bigger than us, and we incorporate joy in that.

Larry Jesse: One of our big Eminence exemplars is for community service. We have a very close relationship with our local leadership to say, “What projects do you need done?” Our town requested that we paint the fire hydrants in town, depending on how much pressure was in that fire hydrant. So our kids did the math, did the research.

Thom Coffee: The reality is, all those kids who go and do that, they realize, “I did that. That’s different because I stepped in and filled a need.” Was it hard to do? It wasn’t. Could anybody have done it? Yes, you did it. And so on a larger scale here at Eminence, it’s really about instilling a belief that truly a kid from Eminence, Kentucky, can change the world. And we want them to believe that. So how do we do that? We try to show them that every day.

Student: Yay! You got it!

Student: There he goes.

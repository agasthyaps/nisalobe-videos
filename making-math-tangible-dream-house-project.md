## Article

Whiting Lane Elementary School , in West Hartford, CT, has been recognized for their outstanding work in student growth. Their students come from diverse backgrounds, socio-economically, culturally, and educationally. One of the ways they support all students in pursuing academic rigor is by presenting them with highly engaging projects that require collaboration, problem-solving and attention to detail.

In Kim Hannan’s third grade math class, small groups of students work together to design a dream house, where they wrestle with square footage, unit costs, budget constraints, and negotiation skills—and have a great time doing it. Download the dream houses lesson plan developed by Kim Hannan and West Hartford Public Schools. It also includes a performance task handout for students with a rubric, a sample floor plan , and printable worksheets for flooring and paint calculations.

## Transcript

Student : Do you want to do wood for the living room? Student 2: Yeah, but like it was really light, like white wood. Student : So it’s $1.49 per square foot, so… Karen Kukish : Our kids know that our teachers and our staff members believe in them, and they internalize that belief in themselves, and they have that desire to further their own learning every day. Kim Hannah : All right. Nice job. Keep going. I like it. Karen Kukish : We are a Title I school here at Whiting Lane. We are also an intensive academic school. We focus a lot on growth, on student growth. Perseverance is a huge part of that. Our staff members really know I need to instill this perseverance. I need the kids to want to learn, to want to excel, to want to keep growing and keep mastering those grade-level concepts. Student : I tried to do like 34 plus 34 is 16, and then subtract 48 to see if we could just use one roll for each. Karen Kukish : We have very rich curriculum here in West Hartford. The learning tasks that we’re asking kids to do are very rigorous. Kim Hannah : We are going to jump into our dream house task. You are in different places, and that’s OK. I’ll be walking around and checking in with groups. Today’s project was a dream house task. It was a real-life application of a lot of the skills that they’ve learned so far in math this year. Do computations with decimals, whole numbers, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. So that kind of has them practicing those skills in a real-life way that they might use someday in their life. Student : How many different rooms do we have? Kim Hannah : They had to create a floor plan more than 925 square feet. They had to make sure that all of the room dimensions met their outside dimensions. Student : The perimeter is 110 feet. Kim Hannah : They have to include the flooring for all the rooms. The wallpaper and paint, that was optional. So if they got to that point, if they wanted to and they were still under budget, less than $200,000, they could then go and do the shopping to do the walls. Student : Times 2 Student 2: Times 2. Equals. Student : No way. No way. We’re not doing that Student 2: Get the lighter one. Kim Hannah : There’s one group that has a ball pit, and they are waiting to purchase the balls to fill the ball pit in their house. Dana : We’re practicing math facts, but in a really fun way by making a house, and it’s some people just don’t want to keep doing normal math problems on a sheet. So we make it fun by working on a big project. 80 times 2. 20 square feet per case. Kim Hannah : They love it, and it challenges them and gets them applying their math concepts in different ways. Student : 5 by 6. For both of them? Student 2: No, for the first bathroom. Karen Kukish : Our teachers are selecting projects for students to work through as opposed to simply handing out a worksheet. But it’s really that rich, very meaty type of project that has many steps to it that students really need to think through and struggle through in a good way. Student : And then we’re going to come together and then… Karen Kukish : Which assists in their levels of perseverance and their stamina and their effort, which just supports all of the learning process in the end. Kim Hannah : Their level of math has really elevated through this project. Student : OK, so 12 square units for here, right? Kim Hannah : I have students who came into fifth grade at a kindergarten level in math. I also have students that are testing for seventh-grade honors. It’s one of the bigger ranges that I’ve had in a while. So this task was challenging for all of them. Student : And then make sure we have the same measurements. Kim Hannah : I like how everybody’s got a different job, and you’re helping your group move forward. The way that they worked together and collaborated made each individual feel like they were part of the project, and they all took ownership in the group’s work, and they all brought their own strengths to it. So that kept them engaged. Karen Kukish : It’s about kids having confidence in themselves and believing in themselves. And that’s a huge part of learning. It’s a huge part of life for our kids later down the road. Kim Hannah : Then you go on to paint, right? Student : Yeah. Kim Hannah : So that’s what we’re focused on, yes? Student : Yeah. Kim Hannah : Beautiful! So that’s the site I should see you on.

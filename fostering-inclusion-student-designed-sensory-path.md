# Fostering Inclusion With a Student-Designed Sensory Path

> When kids collaborated on making a sensory path for their school, what started as an occupational therapy zone became a welcoming, playful space that benefited all students.

## Article

STEM teacher Kyley Longo-McGarvey loved the idea of creating a sensory path at her school, Myers Elementary—but what makes this path extra-special is that her students designed it, in collaboration with their peers in special education. Because of the pandemic, notes occupational therapist Wendy Bush, “We’re seeing more dysregulation in the kids.” So, not only will Myers’s sensory path be used for kids with sensory needs; it’s a place where any kid can blow off some steam. If you’d rather purchase predesigned sensory path decals for your school, TheSensoryPath.com is a great resource.

## Transcript

Kyley Longo-McGarvey: So work together, let Lucia make sure she places stuff. Ask her if she thinks the animals should be bigger or smaller, and then you guys can help her adjust it, OK?

Matthew Stinson: Something I don’t think we celebrate is students helping their peers. We focus so much on curriculum, academics, but having that time for students to understand and help one another is something that came organically through this project. They’re coming together for a common goal. Longo-McGarvey: All right, Lucia. How awesome that water looks. Good choice on those pictures.

Student: Look here, look, you can see a turtle head.

Student: A turtle! Longo-McGarvey: Who’s this one?

Student: A seahorse.

Stinson: At Myers Elementary, the sensory path project started with our occupational therapist. She was asking for a spot in the school where she could do some OT. A lot of our autistic students have various sensory needs.

Wendy Bush: Apart, together, apart, together. A sensory path is a guided pathway that provides all sorts of movement and activity. The kids follow the visual markers that are put on the wall or on the floor. It helps with their gross motor skills, bilateral motor integration, postural control, and balance. It gives them that proprioceptive input to help calm the body and get ready to learn. Ooh, good job.

Stinson: I went to our imagination zone teacher and asked her, “Hey, can you print out some material for us to put down on the floor?” She said, “I have a better idea. Why don’t we have the students create it?” Longo-McGarvey: We are going to go ahead and get started on your portion of that sensory path. Now remember, you’re making this for your and all of your peers in the building. Is everybody comfortable in what you’re designing for me today?

Students: Yes. Longo-McGarvey: All right, have fun, start designing. So our fourth graders brainstormed this, after doing some research. They did that by talking to their classmates, our occupational therapists, as well as our special ed teachers.

Bush: I love that the kids did the research themselves and learned about the components of a sensory path and what other kids might need to be able to learn. Longo-McGarvey: From there, the kids got onto Corel Draw, and they started to bring their designs to life.

Bush: There’s jumping jacks and wall push-ups, hopping side to side, hopping on one foot. But there’s also yoga.

Azilee: My favorite part is the tree pose, because you get to calm down in the tree pose.

Sunita: My favorite part of the whole path, it’d probably be the I Spy wall.

Azilee: Lucia came up with the I Spy wall, because she thought her other friends who have disabilities could have fun with it. They have to find the ocean animals. Longo-McGarvey: I also love the hopscotch idea. They actually have words instead of numbers or letters. So when they would start the hopscotch, they would see “I am,” and the first thing they might hop on is “loved,” or “I am important,” “I am smart.” So you guys are doing a great job. These look fantastic. I’m actually going to show you. Remember we did the wall handprints on Friday? We can take transfer tape— Azilee: We had to get a super-sticky tape and then put the sticker on top. And then press it onto the wall, and then we would peel it off. Longo-McGarvey: Perfect. All right, man, let’s see if you can do a push-up.

Student: Let me try my big hands onto the wall. Longo-McGarvey: It’s just a place where any kid can blow off some steam. Doesn’t have to be a student with special needs.

Sunita: If you get frustrated with your work, or if you get anxious, you can go and take a little break from that. Longo-McGarvey: OK, so you guys designed this. I don’t know if you got to see it yet. The superhero banner is at the end of their pathway, where students can pose in front of it and get their picture taken, showing that they’ve completed the sensory hallway.

Sunita: I’m going to feel happy when I see kids using it, because we created it for them.

Azilee: I’m going to feel excited, because I get to see other kids having fun.

Tina Rhine: Lucia has visited the I Spy wall and the push-up wall about 10 times today. Yeah, we didn’t get a lot of work done today, but that’s OK.

Lucia: Playing games are fun! Longo-McGarvey: If students have ownership of an authentic issue in their school and an authentic solution, it’s just shown how much pride they take in it. Hey listen, you guys did such a great job today. You rocked it completely. I think your friends are going to love it. Go ahead and give yourselves a round of applause for how hard you worked today.

Stinson: The students who create the pathway, they achieve more than just a project. Knowing that they’re actually helping other classmates, and to see the smiles on their faces, it’s very meaningful for them.

Lucia: Awesome!

## Transcript

Teacher: Eyes up. Hearts up. Minds sharp. Compassion on full blast. Okay, let’s go.

Newscaster: More than 1500 K through 12 schools across the country plan to shut down.

Politician: We’re now at a point where the appropriate path is to close schools.

Teacher: I’m going to try my best not to get emotional during all this but our District is going to be closed for the next six weeks.

Teacher: In case someone is watching this video from the future, there is a pandemic happening and schools all over the world are closing down.

Teacher: I’m going to have to pack up all my stuff and I am going to head home.

Teacher: All right. We are headed out. Hopefully, we will be here sooner rather than later.

Teacher: Ah, wow. This is not a break, guys. This is a time in which we are starting to figure out what remote learning could look like.

Teacher: It’s not a job that easily translates to working from home. What are we going to do? [laughs] How are we going to do this?

Teacher: How am I going to teach social skills over the internet? Some of my students don’t have internet.

Teacher: We’re all overwhelmed right now. We’re all working from home.

Teacher: Welcome to my makeshift teacher desk area. I’m sorry for the mess.

Teacher: Multitasking in my pajamas.

Teacher: I have been working on distance learning plan every waking hour.

Teacher: All right, so I’m about to go in and start my first online lesson. This feels weird.

Teacher: Argh! I’m so nervous. [laughs] Teacher: Hello, sir. I think your microphone is off.

Teacher: I don’t know what it is.

Teacher: Good morning. Week three of digital learning has begun.

Teacher: Oh, stop. They could not even see today’s work yet.

Teacher: I know what you’re going to say. It’s not working. Don’t give up, guys. Don’t lose hope.

Teacher: Then you’re going to click go off.

Teacher: Good morning, pumpkins. Today we’re going to read another couple of chapters.

Teacher: Here is the data.

Teacher: That’s one; let’s see if we can do ten.

Teacher: Welcome to Band.

Teacher: Guys, I’m not going to lie. That just lifted my mood like exponentially doing something for my kids. I, ah, I miss them and I miss teaching.

Teacher: I’ve gotten a couple emails from parents and– “Good morning. Thank you for the video. She misses you, too. We’ll keep in contact.” Teacher: I feel like it’s been a positive day of quarantine life and distance learning.

Teacher: I almost have 100 percent participation, which I really didn’t think was possible.

Teacher: Day two went much better. [laughs] Day three went much better. And so we are doing the very best that we can.

Teacher: I hope you know, teachers, that you, my beautiful friends are enough. Whatever instructions that you’re providing, whatever tools that you’re giving your students, it’s all enough.

Baby: See you soon.

Teacher: [laughs] Bye, guys.

Schools have a lot of devices these days. But are they using them effectively? “We wanted the experience of using technology to be productive and meaningful, as opposed to just using devices because we had them,” says Bellwood-Antis District director of technology Jamie Forshey.

“We were still using the devices as a standalone.” When Forshey and her team tried out a new model of self-directed blended learning developed by the nonprofit organization the Modern Classrooms Project , she said, “This is it!” See how Myers Elementary teacher Susan Bouslough is using the approach to teach cursive. Learn more about the Modern Classrooms Project, which offers a free online course along with many more resources for student-centered blended learning.

## Transcript

Susan Bouslough: Hey, now the next time, try to make that loop not so wide.

Student: OK.

Susan Bouslough: Do a couple more practices and then call me back.

Student: OK.

Susan Bouslough: There is a misconception with blended learning that the teacher will be unavailable for students and that they are going to be on their iPads all of the time, and that’s so untrue. I’m able to pull small groups or meet one-on-one with students a lot easier since my lessons have been videoed. That’s the beauty of this model. I’m available.

Susan Bouslough: OK, there you go. That’s what I’m talking about.

Jamie Forshey: Since the inception of our one-to-one iPad initiative, we had been looking for more meaningful ways to utilize technology in the classroom and align that with other initiatives such as Student Engagement, Student Voice, Student Choice. When we started utilizing blended learning, one would think that you would walk in and view students working silently on their devices when in fact our classrooms are busy—students are moving around communicating with one another, collaborating.

Susan Bouslough: OK, friends, on in. Get your game board out and your cursive packet.

Susan Bouslough: We decided to do cursive as blended learning because the fine motor skills that students are using to make those letters is difficult to teach a whole group. By using videos and creating a pacing guide, everybody gets what they need.

Chelsea: I got class because you can work at your own speed and you don’t have to wait for other people if you get done before them. You can just keep going.

Christopher: You see how these are crossed off? Those are the letters I did.

Susan Bouslough: For each letter, they do the video with guided notes.

Chelsea: What’s on the screen you would copy on your paper.

Susan Bouslough: Glide up to the skyline, loop back around, go straight down to the grass line. Then come up to the plane line and make a swinging bridge.

Susan Bouslough: Then they do some independent practice with that letter.

Cooper: You write the letter three times on your own to see how good you can do it, and then you sign up for the peer review.

Susan Bouslough: I build in a lot of collaboration in my classroom with the peer reviews. Students are learning from each other.

Chelsea: A friend watches you do two lines—they give you a praise and a push.

Christopher: Because I really like how this is here.

Chelsea: A praise is something that you did good, and a push is something that you can do better.

Chelsea: It’s a little bit too wide.

Susan Bouslough: After that, they do some more practice and they think about that push, and then they sign up for a teacher check. I’m able to look at how they’re forming the letter.

Susan Bouslough: So make sure your little loop back up is not so big.

Susan Bouslough: I tell them if they’re good to go or if we need to revise something. They cross it off on their game board, complete the reflection for that letter, and move on to the next letter.

Susan Bouslough: I need you to put your things in your binder and then come to the carpet.

Susan Bouslough: At the end of class, we do check-ins in order to build community with each other. It’s a way to celebrate everybody’s accomplishments. We have an Excel document with an inspire column so students can nominate others in the room.

Susan Bouslough: Who would you like to nominate that worked really hard today and they helped you?

Chelsea: Today I nominated Ryder because he wasn’t scared to tell me the truth.

Susan Bouslough: Sometimes it’s hard to tell your friends things that they can do better because you don’t want to hurt their feelings. This is awesome that you can be honest with them.

Susan Bouslough: Confidence has blossomed in my classroom from using this method. Students are able to give each other feedback, and then they hold each other accountable for that as well.

Jamie Forshey: For our district, blended learning is so much more than just students watching videos and sitting in front of screens. It encompasses all of those instructional strategies to really create an effective learning environment for students.

Susan Bouslough: Thank you. Great work today.

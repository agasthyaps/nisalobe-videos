## Transcript

Narrator: Well-timed breaks aren’t a waste of classroom time. They help kids re-focus and learn better. Research confirms that during breaks our brains continue to work on tasks that are crucial to learning, mulling over complex problems, consolidating information, and finding novel patterns of meaning. So, to boost productivity along with creativity and social skills, plan for frequent pauses throughout the school day. Children’s voices: Movement breaks!

Narrator: Play “Statue Freeze.” Ask kids to move around the room—walking, hopping, skipping, or tiptoeing—then say, “Be a statue of a… lion! Bear! Baby bunny! Anything!” and have kids freeze in that pose, then say, “Un-freeze!” and start the cycle again. For a quick, unstructured break that re-sets the classroom mood, play a lively song, and have a one-minute dance party. Or do “Opposite Sides” by having students blink with their right eye while snapping with their left fingers, then switch. Children’s voices: Super fun silly breaks!

Narrator: You can conjure up a rain storm. Have kids tap on their desks with one finger, then two, three, four, finally their whole hands, until you’re all in a downpour. Then do it in reverse as the storm recedes. Or have kids hold different markers in each hand and draw or scribble to the beat of a song for 30 seconds, then pair them with a classmate to see if drawings turned into anything familiar or interesting. Or put kids in small groups and ask them to imaging they’re an animal and keep it to themselves. When you give the okay, each child silently acts out their animal, while classmates guess. Children’s voices: Calming breaks!

Narrator: When kids look drowsy, have them rub their hands together vigorously until they warm up. Ask them to close their eyes and gently place their hot hands over their eyes, then have them breathe deeply as they melt away the clutter in their minds. Or have kids breathe colors: Ask them to inhale a deep green, for example, and exhale a sky blue. When a student feels angry, suggest exhaling the color red. It can be a powerful way to release difficult emotions. You can have students pant like a dog with their tongues out for 15 seconds, then continue for another 15 seconds with mouths closed, taking short breaths with one hand on the belly, focusing on the rise and fall of each breath. A last idea, consider planning nothing. Just let kids chatter for a few blissful minutes before bringing them back to attention.

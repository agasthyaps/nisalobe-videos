## Transcript

Teacher: Pom-pom jar is a positive reinforcement strategy that promotes kindness. Whenever they help someone, they can put a pom-pom in the jar. Eric, I see you put a pom-pom in the jar. What did you do?

Student: I helped Kachi to spell some word.

Students: Fantastic.

Teacher: So first you get your materials and then you give some example of what’s kindness. You can say nice words to someone, share pencil, eraser, or pass out papers. Each time a student put a pom-pom in the jar, we will say what the kid did.

Student: I helped Dana put her garbage in the garbage can.

Students: Fantastic.

Teacher: When the pom-pom gets full, we will have our classroom party. So once I introduce this activity, kids are more peaceful. I don’t see that much arguments. The kids help each other.

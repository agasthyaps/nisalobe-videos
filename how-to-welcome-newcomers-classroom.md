## Article

According to the Center for Immigration Studies , in 2021, nearly one in four students in the U.S. came from an immigrant family , and a growing number of those students are new arrivals to the country. These learners often face complex obstacles in the classroom when it comes to understanding a different language, connecting with other students, and catching up academically. By intentionally honoring home cultures, encouraging peer support, and providing technology to bridge language gaps, teachers can help newcomers settle into the classroom—and set them up for success.

These strategies not only support students who have just come to the country, but create a holistic culture of acceptance, collaboration, and risk-taking. To find more resources for supporting newcomers, read Nirmala Ramsaran’s article for Edutopia titled “ 4 Effective Strategies for Supporting Newcomer English Learners ,” and to see more of the strategies from the teachers featured in this video, watch “ Making Space for Native Languages in Newcomer Classrooms ,” “ Tailoring Instruction to Support English Language Learners ,” and “ Developing Confidence Through Delayed Grading .”

## Transcript

Narrator: Students who have just arrived in a new country face complex challenges in the classroom due to language barriers, culture shock, and potential gaps in education, and in the U.S., one in four students come from immigrant households. As a teacher, how can you provide resources and build a sense of belonging for a growing number of newcomer students from all over the globe, who may have vastly varying needs?

Narrator: Finding ways to represent the different cultural and linguistic backgrounds of your students can go a long way in making genuine connections in your class. Dedicate an area in your classroom where students can share and showcase their home cultures through flags, phrases, and photos, and ask your students for help on how to pronounce their names and common words in their native language correctly. Write these out phonetically on a note to keep at your desk. It’s OK to feel silly or out of your element when trying to use a new language. Your students navigate this every day. Creating a classroom culture that celebrates taking risks and honors students’ cultural identity makes for a welcoming environment to learn in.

Narrator: In many cases, newcomers have a lot in common and can collaborate with each other for translation, acclamation, and encouragement. Group students who speak similar languages into home teams that sit together for a portion of each class. Assign roles for each student in the group based on their strengths. For example, a student who is fluent in English could be a translator, or a student who is comfortable with technology could facilitate tech. These interpersonal connections lay a foundation of social and emotional support for newcomers who are deciphering language and academic content daily, and bolster confidence as students tap into and share their strengths.

Narrator: Providing access to tools that bridge language gaps can make assignments and routines more approachable for newcomers and can further build English language development. Offer online translators and visual dictionaries to students so they can access the definition, image, and pronunciation of words in English as you progress through your lessons. By intentionally connecting with newcomer students, honoring their heritage, and providing supportive systems in your classroom, you can create a space where all learners can confidently take on challenges together.

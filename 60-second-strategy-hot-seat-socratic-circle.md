## Article

In Jennifer Montgomery’s seventh-grade English class in Eminence, Kentucky, there are no students zoning out during class discussions. That’s because she expects the students in the outer circle—the ones who are traditionally supposed to observe and actively listen to the students in the inner circle—to look for opportunities to jump in when they have something to add to the conversation. She reserves a single empty seat in the inner circle for these contributors, labeled “the hot seat,” and it’s made all the difference for bumping up participation in her Socratic seminars.

“It propels the discussion,” she says. “Sometimes it turns the discussion in a different direction. And it keeps them on their toes.” For more strategies on managing Socratic circles, read Mary Davenport’s article for Edutopia, “ Building a Culture of Student-Led Discussion ,” or watch this Edutopia video, “ Scaffolding Discussion Skills With a Socratic Circle .”

## Transcript

Teacher : And a quick reminder down at the end, we also have a hot seat. So if you are in the outer circle, jump in a hot seat. Teacher : In a traditional Socratic seminar, the students in the inner circle are discussing the material, and then in the outer circle, they’re actively listening. I use a strategy called the hot seat. It’s a really great way to help the outer circle feel engaged. First, I set up an empty seat at the end of the inner circle. I instruct students that if they have something that they would like to say that pertains to what the inner circle is discussing, they can get up from their seat. They go jump in the hot seat. They wait to be recognized by the discussion director. Then they can say their comment or their question and then return back to their seat. It propels the discussion. Sometimes it turns the discussion in a different direction, depending on what the person has added. It keeps them on their toes looking for an opportunity or for something that they might want to add to the conversation. Student : Why do you think Salvo was going better?

## Transcript

Teacher: Is everyone ready to give us their updates? Timer set?

Teacher: Yep.

Teacher: Who wants to go first?

Teacher: One week from tomorrow is going to be our first news broadcast.

Teacher: A stand up meeting, the key to it is, it’s only fifteen minutes. We’re really cognizant of using teachers’ time well. This is the way we’ve been doing faculty meetings for five years. We get the teachers into a circle. I call for a volunteer to start, and then we start the update process. We go in order around the circle. People bring up what they’re concerned about, what’s going on in their classroom.

Teacher: We’re going to Eastern State Penitentiary to do performances.

Teacher: They share great ideas.

Teacher: Because we’re going to do a historical narration for their pieces.

Teacher: What they want to celebrate. It’s really uncomfortable to have a long meeting standing up. So if people don’t have something that’s significant to say, they don’t say it. We have never gone over fifteen minutes. We can get exactly the same amount of information out as like a two hour faculty meeting.

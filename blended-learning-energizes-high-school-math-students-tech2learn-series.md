Tech2Learn Video Series Our video series goes inside the classrooms of educators who use technology tools in their lessons every day. Learn from their challenges, celebrate their successes, and share their resources in every episode. This series is a co-production with the Teaching Channel .

Additional Resources and Tools from Mr. McIntosh Oakland Unity High School Peter McIntosh teaches math at Oakland Unity High School, a high-expectation charter school in Oakland, CA. Khan Academy Khan Academy is an educational website featuring over three thousand videos in many core academic subjects.

Students work through interactive challenges at their own pace, while teachers have access to interactive dashboards to monitor and assess student progress. Unity High School Khan Academy Blended Learning Program ( Getting Smart ) In the first six months after moving to blended learning by integrating Khan Academy tools, Peter McIntosh and former Oakland Unity principal David Castillo noted a dramatic shift in student test scores, along with students taking more responsibility for their own math education. On this landing page, education blog Getting Smart describes the report they compiled to share their results.

You can download the full report “Are We Asking the Right Questions?” (PDF) here . McIntosh and Castillo also co-authored two blog posts for Getting Smart on their experiences, “Khan Academy: Learning Habits vs. Content Delivery in STEM Education” and “Khan Academy: Students Regain Confidence to Tackle Math Challenges.” Khan’s Effect on Homework Scores (PDF) One of the great things about Khan, McIntosh says, is that it encourages students to persevere, and now, through the use of the site, his students are doing more problems.

This chart shows how the number of Khan exercises students do is reflected in their test scores.

## Transcript

Blended Learning: Re-Engaging Math Students with Tech Integration (Transcript) Peter McIntosh: For whatever reason, kids come to us with some significant gaps in their math. But more important, they come to us with some poor math habits. What we’re using Khan for, basically, is it’s a way of reengaging them in the math.

Peter: I’ll leave that up there, use that as your model if you need it. Go into Khan System Elimination 0.5. If you do that easily, if you finish that, move onto the Elimination 1.0.

Peter: These are primarily sophomores; they’ve taken algebra before and did not pass. We started out with some relatively easy problems, systems of elimination. This is 0.5. There’s a model on the board for them to sort of follow, talk to each other if they need a little bit of help, ask me if they need a little bit of help. When they’re in Khan, basically a problem is presented and they can choose to watch a video or more often what they’ll do is choose to see hints. The hints are basically the steps. It’s not uncommon for a problem to be broken down into five or seven or eight steps with some brief explanations about what each step is.

Student: Yes, so what I did was take a hint. So like, what it basically says, “Beginning by moving the Y term in the second equation to the right side of the equation…” David Castillo: And you can ask for a hint. You can watch a video. You can ask a peer. So you’ve got three opportunities to try and help yourself and then after that, you raise your hands. The teacher is working with the students that he or she needs to be working with at that time. And other kids, for the most part, are engaged in doing what they’re doing. So it really changes the dynamic between the teacher and students in the classroom.

Peter: And I can see where they’re proficient and where they’re not.

Peter: The teacher has access to something called Coach Mode and it allows us to go in and see a variety of things. At a glance, I can see it for the whole class, you know, how many exercises they’ve completed, who’s progressed and who hasn’t. And there’s a variety of other ways I can go in and get a quick assessment of where students are.

Peter: If I want to pick a particular exercise, I can go in here. And see this student has some difficulty; watched the video, took a number of hints.

Peter: When I’m working with a student one-on-one, I can go even deeper and see the specific problems they’ve tried. I can see the steps that they took. I can get some sense of where they went wrong.

Student: I could definitely do the work.

Peter: So here. So write down the problem.

Peter: Historically, it was really hard to get the kids engaged. They couldn’t get the help right when they wanted it. There was no immediate feedback if it was right or wrong. It was easy for them to sort of get lost and just sort of drift in class. Well, now they have to keep moving because they know we’re keeping track of the problems they’re finishing and they want to see the progress bar move; they want to see themselves become proficient in the exercises.

Student: I hope I’m getting two Ys.

Peter: Yes, you plug it in the… Student: I know.

Peter: Trust me, you got it.

Student: I know.

Peter: Previously, we had a hard time getting the kids to do homework. Well, now with Khan, it’s a little bit easier to get them to do that work. There’s less wiggle room for them to sort of back out, because they’ve got hints they can take or videos they can watch and you’re measuring the work they’re doing.

Student: I kind of don’t know this… Peter: And they’re doing many more problems this year than they did last year. And there’s no substitute for practice.

Student: And the good thing about it is it tells us when we need to review it and we could go back and take hints again or we can just keep on going.

Peter: Their behavior, their habits were changing. We started to notice these kids were staying engaged. We’d look at screens of our coaching data and see kids repeatedly trying. Watch the video here; he’s taking some hints. They’re taking ownership and they’re developing more of an attitude of “I’m going to figure this out.” Peter: Move on to adding segments. I’ll pull one of those up shortly too, okay.

Peter: But then what we started to notice too was a real difference in their test scores. The average score is up about 30 to 40 percentage points and many, many more students in the advanced range.

Peter: Multiplied by negative two.

Peter: What is it about Khan that works? Part of it is the fact that it’s simply a computer and there’s something engaging about anything on computers. I think that it’s an important part that it’s one on one, the fact that they can get help right now on this problem at this step. So that immediacy, that individuality is a big part of it. But I think something about the design of Khan in particular, you know, it’s not multiple choice so you can’t guess your way through. The problems are randomly generated so you can’t copy from another student; you would have to do the work.

Student: I was doing the top one here.

Peter: Okay.

Student: But then I did the bottom one right there.

David: It shows us that every single student, when given the chance, wants to learn. They want to be successful. We’re seeing students just turn on, you know, left and right.

Peter: We see more focus. We see more attentiveness. We see more engagement. We see the kids this year less apt to give up in the first couple of seconds and the basic skills are also better because they’ve been engaged, they’ve done the work and that’s the real magic.

Narrator: Teachers, parents and even state legislatures are demanding more recess for young kids. But there’s still a nagging sense that recess is a privilege. And students are sometimes denied playtime if they misbehave or fall behind in their academics. That’s a serious mistake. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, recess isn’t a nice-to-have, it’s crucial and necessary for a child’s development. There are the obvious health benefits, but recess also enhances creative thinking, focus and social skills like cooperation and sharing, too. So, recess should never be withheld as punishment. And replacing it with academic seat time, ignores the proven cognitive benefits of playtime. In fact, kids need more recess, not less. Experts recommend 60 minutes of exercise every day, but only 24 percent of children actually meet that goal. And so, far, only a handful of states require recess in elementary schools, often for only 20 minutes each day. So, we need to commit to the idea that playtime has value and is a fundamental requirement of education. The research suggests that it simply cannot be optional.

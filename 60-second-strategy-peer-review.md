## Transcript

Susan Bouslough: Are you ready?

Student: On this one you’re, like, down below the grass line, but on, like, this one you’re above it.

Susan Bouslough: Students came up with the method for the peer review. I wanted students to be able to collaborate more, to work with others in the room, not necessarily just their friends. The first step is, they sign up on our back board for a peer review. Another student who is at that same point will erase that name and then meet up with the student and say, “Hey, I’m ready for a peer review.” They each do a praise—something that they did well—and then a push— something to do better on.

Student: They’re supposed to be like that.

Susan Bouslough: They’re able to learn to talk to each other, to give feedback, which is so important for a young learner.

Student: It’s a little bit big.

Susan Bouslough: They’re able to take that feedback, then, to improve their work.

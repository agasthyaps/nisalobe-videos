How you arrange your seating can be an asset for differentiating instruction. Summit Preparatory Charter High School in Redwood City, California, uses different seating configurations for independent work, collaborative work, mini lessons, and large-group discussions. Through scaffolded guidance from their teachers —which includes a personalized learning platform, daily goals, and a culture of formative assessment—students understand how they learn best and what resources they need, enabling them to choose and set up the seating arrangement that works best for them each day.

Summit uses furniture with wheels—trapezoidal and rectangular tables and soft fabric lounge chairs with tablet arms—to make it easy for students to move the furniture. Used furniture networks, like The Reuse Network , can be great resources, says Myron Kong, a Summit real estate team member, who adds that another way to lower costs when purchasing furniture is to aggregate all school orders into one. Here’s how Summit creates a flexible learning environment to support differentiated instruction.

Understand Your Students’ Needs Before you can plan your physical space, you need to know the needs of your students, and surveys can you help you figure those out. Try questions like “Do you want to work independently or with a group?” and “Do you want to learn from a Socratic discussion or a video?” To learn more about creating surveys—and to learn about other free tools Summit uses to differentiate student learning—see “ Challenging Every Student in the Room .” Plan Your Physical Space Design different seating configurations students can choose from when they come in. Chris Kelly, a history teacher, suggests asking yourself about the best spaces for independent and collaborative work, and how many students will want mini lessons.

“Have a clear, data-driven objective for why you want students to rearrange the space in the classroom. It is easier to articulate, get buy-in, and have students appreciate the personalized ways that you are helping them to learn,” explains Cady Ching, a biology and AP environmental science teacher. Post-it Note Goals Students’ Post-it note goals Before breaking out into the different seating options, Kelly’s students write their goals for the day on Post-it notes and stick them on the whiteboard.

They write down what they want to accomplish for the day, noting specific tasks or what they hope to achieve by working alone, with a group, or in a mini lesson. The goals can be things like helping their fellow students after they finish a chapter or unit, understanding specific skills, or reaching certain checkpoints. This increases transparency and allows Kelly to better help his students.

It also enables students to make the best choices for their own learning, choosing their seating arrangement and their collaboration partners. Independent Work Have your students move tables against the walls. Their backs will face you, increasing transparency.

“If they’re working with their computers [or other materials], I can see specifically what they’re working on at a given moment,” says Kelly. This transparency enables you to check in on your students, offering encouragement or guidance when needed. This table configuration also limits distraction, moving students away from others’ discussions.

Collaborative Work Have your students move tables to the sides of the classroom and work in groups of two to four students per table. With one group per table, your students will be able to make direct eye contact with each other and share their screens or resources with each other, says Kelly. For larger groups of up to six students, push two tables together.

Make sure there’s enough space for you to walk around each table so you’re able to check in with every student. Summit students collaborate. Mini Lessons When doing mini lessons for small groups of two to three students, have them move a table to the middle of the room.

“For a larger mini lesson, place students at the center in collaborative seating, preventing a ‘teacher-at-the-front-talking’ mode. Facilitate think/pair/shares during the lesson,” suggests Kelly. When doing mini lessons for larger groups, resources such as overhead displays can be a factor in determining the placement of groupings.

Media carts with a projector and speaker can create more flexibility, or a projector can be ceiling-tracked to save floor space. Three Summit students receive a mini lesson from Kelly while others work on their own and in groups. Large-Group Discussions For group discussions, like Socratic seminars or fishbowl discussions, group students in the middle of the classroom.

“They sit in a circle, facing each other, usually with no tables so that open body language is encouraged. It gives them an opportunity to both show knowledge they researched in preparation for the Socratic seminar and to have the quiet space for discussion,” says Ching. Aukeem Ballard, a Habits, Community, and Culture teacher, uses this same table-less circle configuration for whole-class discussions.

In fishbowl discussions, 15 students sit in a circle at the center of the room and discuss a topic, and the other 15 sit outside the inner circle, listening and taking notes on the discussion. Summit students and Ching circle up for a discussion. “No matter what the physical space might be, it’s the students making decisions to learn that marks a culture of learning,” says Kelly.

“It matters more on who is in that space and the kinds of decisions that educators make to set students up to make positive choices for their learning.”

## Transcript

Chris Kelly: If you’re going to work independently to catch up, you’ll actually turn the tables toward that wall. If you’re going to collaborate, you’re going to be at this table or you’re going to be at this table. All right, go. By differentiating in a space that’s small or where you have a lot of students we are able to set students up with the learning situations in which they can learn best. Penelope Pak McMillen: Here at Summit we serve a wide range of students and so you’ll see a varying degree of skill within an academic classroom. Providing flexible space gives students the opportunity to learn in different ways. And it also gives the teacher the opportunity to coach them properly in a personalized manner to reach their learning goals.

Chris Kelly: If you guys want to work independently, what is going to be the best place and the best people to be next to you to work independently? Those who want the mini-lesson are going to come to this table. We provide a lot of flexibility for learning environments, whether it’s flexibility in terms of the physical space, flexibility in terms of the different choices that students have. You see students seated toward the back of the room. Those students are working independently. The students who are at the tables have chosen to collaborate, which is something they thought through and made part of their goal-setting. And then you have the group of students that chose one of the two mini-lessons and that takes place in the center of the classroom.

Student: Is it better to have more body paragraphs or conclusion?

Chris Kelly: Sometimes a student will write a better thesis and the conclusion than they do at the opening, because they’ve had a chance– Kayla: We wanted to collaborate, because we’ve been helping each other on the steps that we had to do. And especially since they’re so long we kinda thought, “Oh, let’s just work together.” Also, I think if we were to be at other tables we’d probably be more distracted.

Kayla: Like, each slide has a different objective.

Taylor: This is, like, summarize each slide in your own words, I guess.

Kayla: Yeah.

Taylor: When the classroom’s flexible we can learn a lot more from each other and it forms a better bond with the students within the school and also the staff members. Penelope Pak McMillen: You may walk by one room and see work time and the teacher floating around and giving one-on-one support to kids. Or you might see the teacher in the middle of a small group giving a quick mini-lesson on something, then moving right on to the next group of students. Or you might see kids in a circle engaging in a Socratic seminar and having a dialogue about an issue that is tied to their class content.

Student: How is e-waste to cycle?

Student: You buy something and then companies start making more products.

Cady Ching: Today in biology I grouped them together in the middle of the classroom so that they could have a space that was conducive to a discussion.

Student: Is e-waste preventing our choice or our duty?

Student: I think it’s our choice, because nobody really tells us to do it.

Student: I agree with you. I feel like it’s our choice right now, but it should be our duty ‘cause it’s important to make the world a safer place.

Cady Ching: Other students are in the process of gathering information for the experimental design project. So, they were seen in the outside, facing outwards so that I could see their screens and help them work through any distractions they might have. It’s hard sometimes to stay focused, especially as freshmen. All right, go ahead and move. If they’ve mastered that or if they are ready to move on to the next thing, then our classrooms, you know, support that transition by being able to very quickly move desks and chairs into different groupings for the next part of the class period. You guys move quickly and safely. Penelope Pak McMillen: It is important to have furniture that allows me to create different types of learning environments for the students. And, so, we have tables that have wheels on them, so it’s easy to transition into a different configuration. It doesn’t disrupt the learning too much.

Aukeem Ballard: Buenos días.

Students: Buenos días.

Aukeem Ballard: Everybody can talk about what this quote means to you and what your response is to the quote.

Student: You can’t control your circumstances always.

Aukeem Ballard: I will have a whole-class discussion. It’s called a whip-around and we’ll go around the entire circle and have people share-out that way. It just is a way so that we hear more voices and make sure there’s a diversity of thought in the room.

Janet: Some of us are minorities and, like, we have experienced certain things that are– When we’re sitting in a circle and everyone can look at each other and be aware of each other I feel like it makes you learn a lot better. Like, you grasp concepts more once you see a face. Penelope Pak McMillen: What’s really exciting about the flexible space is that it allows kids to really understand what type of learning works for them and it equips the teacher with ways that they can deliver more personalized instruction to the kids.

Student: It makes a lot more sense.

Cady Ching: Yay!

## Transcript

Linda: Creating healthy contexts and environments in every part of our lives is important for learning. Families can learn skills as adults that make the home environment more peaceful and productive, and can reinforce for children the skills that they’re learning in school.

Glenn: This is kind of good at problem solving and we should do this at home.

Anna: There you go.

Glenn: Thank you.

Anna: We try really hard here to build relationships with families and to let them know all the things that we’re doing.

Parent: Which one do you have there?

Student: You are getting to a fish at recess.

Parent: Oh, okay.

Anna: So that their kids can know, okay, we’re all a team, we’re all working together, and everything that I’m teaching you goes along at home as well. Every time you have a problem, you have to think to yourself, how big of a problem is this and how am I going to choose to respond? Once a month, we do a family social emotional learning lesson, so that families can kind of see the things that their kids are learning in school. It’s super powerful for parents to be able to see that you can teach kids to practice managing their emotions and using strategies to calm down and expressing themselves in expected and safe ways. How big of a problem is this, and how am I going to choose to respond? So why is it so important that you pay attention to the size of the problem? Why do we care?

Student: If it’s a tiny problem, you react how you’re supposed to, not like, act like it’s a big problem.

Linda: The family SEL lesson is presented in part to help the children practice the skills that they’re learning in school, but they’re also teaching the adults social and emotional management skills, which most of us need. We grew up at a time when this was not an explicit kind of teaching. We’re all trying to figure it out. And parents and family members need these skills as much as little children do. So it’s a brilliant way to help everyone develop their own social emotional capacities.

Anna: As educators at Lister, we feel that it’s really important that these types of strategies are taught explicitly, just like we would teach math. And so it’s really cool for families to be able to come in and see the things that their kids are learning, so that they can manage themselves and their relationships.

Glenn: Someone is reading your library book without your permission. I felt like when I was going to school, they just kind of like shoved you through.

Student: Before school, you’re playing outside and you lose your homework.

Glenn: Ooh, what do you think.

Student: I think it’s like a three.

Glenn: I think to be able to verbalize it and express in the right manner, I think that’s very important. You got it right, just like it says on the paper.

Anna: This type of exercise is beneficial to everyone. I think it’s really important for families to see that nine and ten year olds can do this work and are doing this work, and that they can transfer it to daily life in and out of school. You can’t find your pencil and you notice that someone took it.

Student: It’s not a big deal because it’s just a pencil.

Student: Dude, it’s just a pencil. Go get another one.

## Article

Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School has a variety of spaces students can use to physically remove themselves from a negative situation. These de-escalation zones allow students to calm down and then try to understand and assess their feelings, either on their own or with adult guidance. This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School .

## Transcript

Rico Page: I appreciate y’all coming and have a conversation.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: There’s a lot we do within the building to create spaces that are conducive for de-escalation. Kids are able to remove themselves from a negative situation, process what has caused the crisis, and make different choices about how to move forward.

Rachael Hunt: Sometimes it’s not the easiest thing in the world to tell a kid, “I know all this is happening to you. “I know all of this is going on, “but I want you to learn.” And so we are giving them a space and a context to process some of that emotion, to de-escalate, and then transition back to class.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: Many of our classrooms have what we call de-escalation spaces, so they’ll be a bean bag in the corner or a curtain that allows you to step away. Just something that creates a little bit of separation for kids that the teacher recognizes need that or the student.

Tanzye Hill: Hi how are you?

Mary: I’m decent.

Tanzye Hill: Students come to me, I greet them, and then I just give them alone time. Because I don’t associate the space necessarily with academics, it’s easier for them to utilize it outside of the classroom and recognize it as a safe space. For myself when my emotions are high, it’s best to calm down before I begin to try to communicate.

Mary: It’s giving us a time to cool down, do the coloring. It gives me opportunity to be like, “Okay yeah, “take in this breath. “I can talk now without trying to cry.” Just letting us do that makes it better.

Tanzye Hill: So then they’ll begin to share and open up about what’s bothering them. How was that?

Mary: It wasn’t good.

Tanzye Hill: We really try to teach our kids how to be resilient, how to utilize resources, and take care of themselves.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: We have another space where our counselor’s located.

Rico Page: All right, so you’re gonna talk first. And when he get done, you’re gonna talk, okay?

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: Who does real time conflict resolution.

Student: I didn’t wanna tell you who to hang with.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: We can’t expect people to just get along, we have to show them what getting along looks like.

Rico Page: You have an issue with a teacher, with another student, they come to my room and we have a conversation like, “Hey, what happened?” Today I had two students. They’ve been friends for about two or three years. They had a big old fight with another boy. We stopped ’em outside, and we brought ’em in. Both are strong young men.

Dr.

Sonia Stewart: What is going to happen, is knowing how I contributed to the conflict, right? And how to respond to you with empathy. DeMarcus: I wasn’t solving it out the right way. I should’ve communicated better.

Rico Page: We come to the table and say, “Hey, it ain’t about you. “It’s about respecting each other.” Y’all go ahead and go back to class, and that’s it. Anything happen, come back here, alright? DeMarcus: We took it upon ourself to go have a conversation with the other gentlemen that was arguing, and then that’s when we got everything solved.

Rachael Hunt: When we have de-escalation spaces where we’re teaching them to manage themselves, then we make it so they can be successful anywhere. Saying just power through or white knuckle through something, is not a strategy. When you say, “I see you, I recognize you, “and I’m gonna teach you how to take that moment “to walk away, recenter, “and come back and do what you need to do.” That’s actually teaching resilience and Student: When I just feel like I’m not doing something right, and I just need a moment.

## Transcript

Brains don’t actually take breaks. There’s no downtime from thinking. In a 2021 study, researchers used highly sensitive brain scans to take a peek at neural networks as young adults learned to type. Digging into the data revealed some mysterious patterns. During breaks, the brains of the participants appeared to head back to their keyboards, unconsciously replaying the typing sequences over and over again, at astonishing rates of speed, flipping the material between processing and memory centers dozens of times in the span of 10 seconds. We process less during the active phase of learning than we imagined, and in fact breaks play just as important a role as practice in learning a new skill. Time off task, paradoxically, is critical time on task. The kinds of breaks we take make a difference, too. In a 2022 study, researchers compared classroom breaks like drawing, crafts, and puzzles to less structured nonacademic time like running, jumping, and playing in sandboxes. In a nod to the power of movement and free time, it was the kids playing outdoors who came back most ready to learn. Probably because indoor games, like indoor voices, require children to engage in more self-regulation. Finally, a 2022 analysis of 14 studies examining the learning impact of brief green breaks of 10 to 90 minutes, like a walk in the park, a visit to a school garden, or gazing at a green landscape, concluded that students who partook in the activities performed better on tests measuring attention and working memory. Depriving kids of regular breaks, it turns out, is a threat to the whole proposition of learning. To commit lessons to memory, the brain demands its own time, which it sets aside to clean up and consolidate new material.

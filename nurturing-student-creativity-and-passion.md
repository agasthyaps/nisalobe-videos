## Transcript

Jason Corosanite: So the name String Theory is a little bit of a play on our strings program, but also is a way to bring science to the forefront. In physics string theory was a way to rationalize how you can have mutually exclusive worlds operate at the same time in perfect harmony. In education kids need some rigor in academics, but also things like innovation and joy and creativity. String Theory Schools is based here in Center City, Philadelphia. Some of our overarching design elements are our pathways, the passion, our mobile first approach to technology integration, and our real world culture.

Cashier: Mallory Jason Corosanite: We began with the idea of giving students the opportunity to figure out what type of learner they are, and also what type of creative they are. So in our school model we have a 90-minute-longer school day that begins in kindergarten, and they have seven extra classes: vocal music, instrumental music, classical ballet, French as a foreign language, creative writing, visual arts, and science and technology.

Teacher: Alright, vinegar’s done!

Rosemary Schneider: They have those classes once a week, and the idea is that in the younger grades we’re nurturing them and seeing where their strengths are.

Dominique: Being exposed to all the majors at a young age, you got to feel out where you fit in the best.

Jason Corosanite: And then by middle school they choose one of those subjects as a major, and then get to spend every single day in that major.

Teacher: You see if you can use those lines and incorporate that into your design.

Rosemary Schneider: We try to really make them think about what area they’re truly passionate about.

Kaitlin: I love to write, act, and film, so I chose TV and broadcasting specifically. You learn so many different things, from script writing to being on camera and being behind the camera.

Teacher: Alright, ready, everybody’s still rolling.

Student: So my major is STEM. I absolutely fell in love with it. We did forensics. We’re doing DNA barcoding and sequencing now. Do five of the sample, right?

Student: Yup.

Abigail: When I found out you could pick a major since I love to dance, I picked ballet. The training’s pretty rigorous.

Dance Teacher: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, continue.

Raven: Playing violin every single day has really taught me time management. I didn’t know how much work would come along with being a professional.

Jason Corosanite: We talk a lot about the discipline that comes from doing something everyday and to really do a deep dive.

Rosemary Schneider: It takes determination. It takes dedication. All of those types of skills are skills that you can also apply to the academic classroom.

Abigail: I get a lot of people saying, “You just dance everyday.” but we are really focused on getting our education and going to dance or singing, whatever your into. It’s really equal.

Jason Corosanite: Another overarching design element is our mobile-first approach to technology integration. We know that how students consume content and create content is first and foremost through mobile, so we gave them all iPads that were both 1-to-1 and 24/7 with the idea that that was gonna be the primary device for them to engage with their learning.

Joseph: You’re learning completely differently. You’re learning off Apple TVs as opposed to blackboards.

Abigail: All of our courses are on iTunes U, so I’ll go to english, click the course. I’ll go to history, I’m gonna do the same thing. So it’s just nice having everything in one screen or our teachers are constantly getting us to be creative with our projects and what apps we use.

Teacher: Very nice, so this I think is the most important part.

Jason Corosanite: Lastly, we have artists in residence, scientists in residence, and entrepreneurs in residence that really are bringing a real world perspective to these kids, all while going about their school day.

Teacher: And once this gets to about 350, we’re gonna start our roast.

Rosemary Schneider: I think just seeing the professionals in their element I think it makes it more cool. All of a sudden it made it real. It was like, Oh I can actually do this with my life?

Abigail: My teacher here, she’s been dancing her entire life. She pushes us to be the best that we can be. She makes us focused.

Dance Teacher: 5, 6, 7, 8 Kaitlin: Some of the biggest benefits are the creativity and the innovation that we all have gained from this environment. If I didn’t have an instrumental class, or if I didn’t have experience in the Cafe Vine, I wouldn’t have been able to develop into myself.

Jason Corosanite: When kids get a chance to do something they like everyday they become really well developed kids. So giving kids an opportunity to find different ways to pursue their passion is really central to our approach to learning.

Student: Actors ready? Sound, Camera? Action.

## Article

Child’s Play NY works in classrooms across New York City to help teachers learn how to use theater games for a multitude of purposes—building classroom culture, activating student voice, and connecting to curriculum. In Sammi Priti’s first-grade classroom at Arts and Letters 305 United in Brooklyn, Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene visits during a morning meeting to demonstrate “I Have a Gift for You,” a game where students practice using each other’s names, expressing their thanks, and tapping into creativity. The result is a sense of gratitude and positivity that lasts throughout the day—and beyond.

## Transcript

Jocelyn Greene: Who likes getting gifts here?

Jocelyn Greene: Theater games are an amazing tool for morning meeting, when your kids are kind of getting to know each other. They want to feel seen and known and heard, and they’re opportunities to get their voices out, get their peers laughing, and it fosters such connection between the classroom teacher and the students.

Jocelyn Greene: I want you guys to think about a gift that you would love to get.

Student: You could speak any language and you could understand any language.

Jocelyn Greene: The game I have a gift for you is a really sweet way to build community. It’s also an incredible way to get kids accessing their imagination.

Jocelyn Greene: You circle up and you would say the person’s name next to you.

Jocelyn Greene: Hey Wyeth, I have a gift for you. It’s a magical hamster.

Jocelyn Greene: And he would say, thank you Jocelyn. He would take that, put it down, and then reach behind himself and grab another gift for somebody else.

Wyeth: Hey Maya, I have a gift for you. It’s the power to walk through anything.

Jocelyn Greene: The names are important as much as the thank-you.

Maya: Hey Sagan, I have a gift for you.

Sagan: Thank you, Maya.

Jocelyn Greene: Sometimes what I do is, I say, don’t just give a regular gift. Give a gift that might actually be a little magical and open that door for them to just go into their wonderful childhood goodness where anything is possible.

Student: I have a gift for you. It’s a book with blank pages, and whatever you don’t know, you can just ask it and it will reveal the answer on the page.

Jocelyn Greene: And the practice of being so kind to each other through the game, it embeds a kind of kindness and generosity that has the ripple effect in the classroom well beyond this game.

Gia Truong traces her goal of increasing equity in education to her own immigrant roots. Coming to the United States from Vietnam as a young child, she spoke very little English, and her life here gave her a sense that “language and education are transformative.” Today, Truong is the CEO of Envision Education , a network of three San Francisco Bay Area high schools that serve mainly low-income black and Latino students who are working to be the first in their families to go to college. Creating a supportive culture that “interrupts education inequity” is vital for this community, according to Truong, which is why Envision focuses on making sure that its students have “a strong sense of self” and “feel empowered to change the world.” The numbers tell the story: In 2016, 99 percent of Envision students attended college, compared with 70 percent of high school students nationwide—and 90 percent of Envision students persisted in college from year one to year two. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHxE5Ylmvzg Karimah Omer, a graduate of Envision Academy in downtown Oakland, California, is the first in her family to go to college, making her a role model to her younger siblings.

But like many students in her diverse, low-income neighborhood, she faced academic, financial, and social obstacles—and almost didn’t make it. As a child, Omer—whose family is of Yemeni Muslim descent—worried that college “was not going to be an option for me.” She carried a 4.0 grade point average, but her father was facing financial hardship, and she was concerned that her “appearance and ethnicity” were insurmountable hurdles. But in her sophomore year at Envision, a school at which both the cultural and academic environments are designed to prepare at-risk students for college, Omer began to flourish.

Eventually she was awarded a scholarship, becoming one of the 99 percent of Envision graduates who go on to attend college.

## Transcript

Gia Truong: Equity in education to me means that young people, especially those that are most impacted by inequity, have a strong sense of self, how they’re connected to the world, and feel empowered to change the world.

Teacher: Once you’ve got your peer eds done– Gia Truong: I am originally from Vietnam and I came to the United States when I was seven with my family and I spoke very little English at that time. I discovered that language and education are transformative. And for me and my family it was about survival. So, my first day of high school I was extremely excited, because we moved into a new neighborhood. I came from a pretty poor working class area and I thought it was a new beginning.

Teacher: All right. So, take a look at this screen real quick.

Gia Truong: And the first day of school– it was a geography class– and the teacher said, “Everyone introduce yourself and tell us where you’re born.” My heart dropped. I was terrified that people would know that I’m not from this country. And I remember thinking to myself I hated this country because I don’t belong and then most of all I hated myself for not having the courage to be who I am. That moment really informed what I wanted to do for young people.

Gia Truong: I came to Envision, because I wanted to impact a whole system.

Gia Truong: How are you feeling about being here?

Gia Truong: We serve mostly first-generation college-bound students, mostly low-income African-American and Latino students and they have so many assets. They’re resilient. They are smart. But they do face a lot of challenges. They feel very responsible for their survival of their family and they come from environments where not very much is expected of them. But they come and they realize this is a whole new world. At Envision our teachers push our students to excel and they believe in them. So, when you are just around that, you then believe in it, too. I’m just really proud that eighty percent of our students are accepted to four-year college, right? A hundred percent of them are accepted to two- or four-year college. I mean, I just think that’s fantastic.

Student: You know, I’m always big on leadership and finding myself and I found myself through poetry and all the workshops and projects here.

Gia Truong: And I think that our environment brings that out of them, right? They can be free to like school. They can be open to rigorous academics. They can challenge themselves. They can do what other people think that is impossible for them to do.

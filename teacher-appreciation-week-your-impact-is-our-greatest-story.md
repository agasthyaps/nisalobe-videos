## Article

At Edutopia, storytelling is at the heart of everything we do. We believe stories have the power to illuminate, to connect, and to inspire change. Every story we share begins with educators like you.

And of all the stories we tell, one rises above the rest: the story of teachers and the lasting impact you make. Whether you’ve helped a student find their voice, mentored a new teacher as they find their footing, or sparked a love of learning that lasts a lifetime, your influence reaches far beyond the walls of your classrooms. Each Teacher Appreciation Week, we reflect on what makes education so powerful.

It’s the same answer every year: all of you. This year alone, hundreds of you have contributed articles to Edutopia, generously sharing your classroom-tested strategies and your reflections on what works. Through your contributions, you’ve helped fellow educators build stronger relationships with students, design meaningful learning experiences, and keep growing in their practice.

Many more of you have lent your voices to our reporting on phone calls, in emails, and in our social media channels , helping us better understand the realities of today’s classrooms. You’ve explained the challenges you face and shared the big ideas that help you support deep learning. A number of schools welcomed our video crews this year, opening your doors so we could capture what learning looks like in action.

These visits have allowed us to spotlight your students’ creativity, your thoughtful approaches, and the collaboration that defines so many great learning environments. And at conferences, more than 750 of you visited our team to share ideas and encouragement for your peers. These moments add up to something powerful: a professional community built on generosity and shared purpose.

This video is our team’s small way of saying “Thank you” this Teacher Appreciation Week. Thank you for the time you take, the knowledge you share, and the care you give—to your students and to the wider education community. Your impact is not just part of our mission.

It’s our greatest story.

## Transcript

Edutopia team members: Where do we even begin on the way to a thousand thank-yous? You’ve all been so gracious with your time, your skills, and your knowledge. We’ll start by thanking all the educators—over 650 of you—who wrote articles for us this year about what’s working in your classrooms. You shared your helpful hints, your strongest strategies, and your words of encouragement for fellow teachers. Our editors, writers, and reporters also want to thank the hundreds of teachers who picked up the phone or answered emails to share how you develop resilient learners and to describe your most engaging projects and the ways the most complex topics can be taught to kids. A giant thank-you to the 15 schools who opened your doors this year to welcome our video crews and pass on your wisdom—and the practices that spark those aha! moments. And to the 750 of you who visited our conference booth and wrote down what works for you for the benefit of teachers everywhere. All those things you were kind enough to offer— and everything you give your students…? It all adds up. In return, we’re sending you a thousand thank-yous. (All say “THANK YOU” a couple of times) For your insights, your ideas, and your efforts. Because your impact is our greatest story.

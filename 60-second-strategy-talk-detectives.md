## Transcript

Teacher: Whereas we are having our discussion, we are going to have two talk detectives that are going to be coming around and spying. So today, we used talk detectives, which go round and listen in to pupils’ discussions. And I want you to see if you can spot anybody that is using any of our discussion guidelines, okay? Right, off you go. Discussion guidelines were created in conjunction with the children. We looked at key things that we think make a really good discussion.

Student: You would worship a god if he gave you the power.

Student: I agree with you.

Teacher: Having a clear set of guidelines makes sure that discussion is really, really focused. Ashante, did you hear anybody using any of our discussion guidelines?

Student: I heard that Rea was building onto Ena’s idea.

Teacher: Since I started talk detectives, the children think about their conversations kind of metacognitively, and it has really good learning outcomes as well.

Student: They just came to a shared agreement.

Teacher: Excellent.

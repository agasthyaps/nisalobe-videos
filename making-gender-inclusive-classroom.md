When middle school science teacher Ace Schwarz started trying to make their classroom more gender inclusive, they noticed it was good for everyone. “Students of all identities feel accepted and learn how to be better humans going out into the world—respecting each other, respecting others, and just recognizing that our identities are beautiful and can exist in so many different ways.” Making your classroom more gender inclusive can feel daunting. But it doesn’t have to be, according to Schwarz.

Focus on small changes, and remember, says Schwarz, “it doesn’t all have to be done at once. If you think of it like a gender-inclusive mountain, that peak seems really, really far away. But if you take one tip and just practice that one tip and get really, really good at it, that’s a step up the mountain.

And then you can keep adding new tips as you get really good at the previous ones.” Even these small changes can have a big impact for students. Schwarz was motivated to start implementing them because “I did not have that experience in middle school, and I was very confused about my identity. I didn’t feel affirmed in any way in school….

And so having the opportunity to do so is fulfilling for me. And it just makes my heart really happy because I think that is so important for kids to feel safe and affirmed at school. And I am working towards making that a reality in my own classroom.” Want additional ideas to help you make your classroom more inclusive?

## Transcript

Ace Schwarz: When we teach students to be gender inclusive, we’re teaching them to be better humans to each other, to be kinder, to not make assumptions, to break stereotypes. Gender stuff takes up a lot of brain space, and when kids are free to be themselves and express themselves how they want, they’re able to relax and really focus on learning. When we say “boys and girls” or “ladies and gentlemen,” that’s putting kids into two categories only. For someone who is gender expansive, they pick up on that stuff. And so you could say “everyone,” “y’all,” “learners”—I call my students “epic humans” instead. At the very beginning of the school year, we cover lab safety by looking at a picture. Students often start by saying the girl is standing too close to the flame. And I’ll say, you’re right, that person with long hair is standing too close to the flame. And we really briefly explain that we can’t know someone’s gender just by looking at them. We can describe them by their physical features or use “they.” It takes less than five minutes, and it’s really effective. When students are playing outside, it’s important not to corral all of the masculine-presenting students for sports and have the feminine-presenting students kind of sit and chat and do more delicate things. Anyone can do anything. Anyone can like what they like. Clothes don’t have a gender. Colors don’t have a gender. When kids see that they can enjoy anything that they want, whether it’s colors or activities, it just broadens their perspective and allows them to be creative and be their best selves. Something I find really helpful is displaying pronouns, your pronouns, on your desk, the sign on your door. The very first day of school, I introduce myself, and I have an identity map with lots of different characteristics of who I am as a human. I have a picture of my cat and I, and then I have my pronouns right at the top. That starts the conversation and gets kids thinking about maybe their own pronouns. Sometimes they’re a little apprehensive about it, but when they get my pronouns correct the first couple of times, they’re like, “Yes, I did it.” And then it just becomes so natural that it’s just part of the everyday conversation. I think it’s really important for teachers to know that this work is lifesaving work that is so important for kids to feel safe and affirmed at school, but it doesn’t all have to be done at once. If you take one tip and get really, really good at it, you can keep adding new tips. That is a very manageable way to incorporate this into your teaching practice. But start small, and don’t be too hard on yourself when you make a mistake, because we’re human and everyone makes mistakes. How you handle it and repair the harm and move forward is the most important thing.

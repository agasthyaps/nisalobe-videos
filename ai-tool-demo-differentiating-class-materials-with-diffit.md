## Article

Taking the time to differentiate class materials is a valuable step toward making lessons accessible to all students. Learners are different and have different needs—a typical classroom might be made up of students with a wide range of reading levels. In particular, students with individualized education programs or English language learners may require texts at different levels.

As important as it is, though, differentiation is a challenge—teachers may struggle to find time to hunt down texts for different learners at the appropriate reading levels. Luckily, a new artificial intelligence (AI)–powered tool called Diffit may be able to help. Teachers can copy and paste a passage of text into Diffit, then use the tool to automatically adjust the text to a different reading level—anywhere from “2nd Grade” to “11th Grade+.” Besides raw text, if there is an online article that a teacher wants to modify, they can paste in a link to it directly.

Diffit can even accommodate links to YouTube videos; the tool will automatically access and adjust their transcript to produce a piece of leveled text. Alternatively, teachers can produce entirely new pieces of text on any topic using Diffit’s “Literally Anything” feature. This facet of Diffit is an AI text generator that’s quite similar to more popular ones like ChatGPT—except that Diffit even cites the sources for the information that it outputs.

In addition to leveled texts, Diffit automatically creates a list of key vocabulary words from the passages it generates—as well as offering multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, and open-ended prompts that students can respond to after reading the passage. Diffit even offers teachers some premade, adjustable worksheets—like 3-2-1 reading summaries and graphic organizers—that they can print out and have students fill in. While it’s still important to double-check all outputs of AI for accuracy, the tool allows the task of differentiating class materials to be tackled in an instant, saving teachers valuable time.

## Transcript

Daniel Leonard: Hi everyone. My name is Daniel and I’m an assistant editor at Edutopia. Today, I wanted to demonstrate a tool that’s really useful for making differentiation easier. So this tool is called Diffit, and it has four main functions. I’ll start with this one here. So I’ve heard from teachers who have students at a wide range of reading levels in their class, so they need to be able to adapt their materials, and so they turn to Diffit. As an example, I found this article here that’s about photosynthesis, and it’s at a fifth-to-eighth-grade reading level. So if we copy that link and paste it into Diffit, we can modify that. We could switch it to, let’s say a third-grade reading level. You’re going to want to keep this box unchecked, and if you have Diffit Premium, you can even align the new passage to certain state standards. But I’ll hit “generate” here and let’s see. So now about 10 seconds later, we have the material from that article on photosynthesis adapted to a third-grade reading level. You can even adjust the length if you want to make it a bit longer. And what’s super-useful is that Diffit also pulls out key vocabulary words from the passage, and it also offers multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions and prompts that students can respond to in response to that passage. Returning to the home page, we have this tab here, which is pretty similar to this one, except that it takes in text as an input instead of a link. And then we have this tab, which is a little different. It takes in up to 10 vocabulary words as an input, and it will output a reading passage at whatever reading level you might need that includes those 10 vocab words. Now, lastly, we have the “Literally Anything” tab. This tab, instead of adapting an existing passage, will output an entirely new reading passage at whatever reading level you might want. So I’ll paste in a prompt that I wrote, “Why does the United States have an electoral college?” And I could have Diffit produce an excerpt answering that question at a sixth-grade reading level. We’ll keep the language English, and we’ll keep it informational rather than a fictional text. So again, about 10 seconds later, we now have this new reading passage at a roughly sixth-grade level that talks about why the Electoral College was founded. And unlike some other AI text generators, Diffit will even show the sources for all the claims that it’s making in this AI-generated text. But of course, AI still isn’t entirely reliable, so it’s probably a good idea to double-check that everything in here seems accurate. Again, Diffit will give vocab words from this passage, multiple-choice questions. You can copy these questions and paste them in another document, or if you scroll down here, Diffit also offers some pre-generated worksheets that students can fill out in response to this reading passage. So obviously there are tons of applications of a tool like this. I hear from teachers who have students with IEPs who use it to produce texts at different levels for those students or who have students who are English language learners who also need texts at different levels. So hopefully this is a useful tool to know about. And if you use other tools for differentiation, definitely let us know. We’d love to hear about them. And thanks so much for listening. Bye.

How do you know if students watched—and actually understood—that video you assigned? And how can a tool like SchoolAI help you figure it out? Video is a unique and powerful tool for learning : It engages multiple senses, breaks down complicated ideas into digestible chunks, and demonstrates complex concepts that are challenging to describe with just text alone.

But implementing video inside of a classroom comes with challenges. Students might zone out or watch passively without actively processing key points. And for the teacher, it can be difficult to determine what students really took from the experience, or if they even watched at all.

In this brief demo, Innovation and Technology Coordinator Larisa Black demonstrates how SchoolAI’s Video Explorer tool can transform passive video watching into an engaging, interactive learning experience. Inside of SchoolAI’s platform, as students watch the assigned video, an AI chatbot pauses at key moments to ask probing questions aligned with your learning objectives. These open-ended questions require students to articulate their thinking in writing, ensuring deeper engagement than multiple-choice questions that allow for lucky guesses.

Instead of passively watching, Black says, students are “engaging, asking questions, summarizing ideas, and getting instant feedback as they go.” On the teacher side of the platform, you can monitor each student’s engagement and comprehension level. Clicking the Groups button will prompt the platform to sort each student into groups based on their level of understanding. Setup is simple.

After providing a few key pieces of information—the URL of the video you’d like students to watch, grade level, number of questions you’d like the chatbot to ask, and learning outcomes for the questions—click Launch and the platform does the rest. This is only one feature of several offered by SchoolAI, including a lesson plan generator, tools to help craft individualized education programs, and a range of different chatbots that students can interact with (like the Career Exploration Chatbot ). Interested in creating instructional videos for your students?

Middle school STEAM and math enrichment instructor Jenny Gieras has a few tips . Or, if you want to help students better understand how to use videos as a tool for learning, check out these suggestions from educator Avra Robinson.

Larisa Black: Hi, there. My name is Larisa Black, a science teacher of 16 years, and today I want to show you one of my favorite edtech tools. It’s called SchoolAI. SchoolAI is an all-in-one AI-powered educational platform, which is designed for K–12 students and teachers to personalize learning, automate administrative tasks, and provide real-time insights into student progress. Now, Spaces are these interactive guided experiences powered by AI. First, go to Spaces, click on Discover or create. We’re going to go ahead with Discover because we’re going to use one of the pre-created common activities for our classes. We’re going to get started with Video Explorer, one of my favorites. Video Explorer turns passive video watching into an engaging interactive experience. As students watch that assigned video, an AI chatbot pauses at key moments to ask more probing questions that are aligned to that learning objective. On the teacher side of the platform, you can monitor engagement and see what students are learning in real time. It’s amazing. Setup is quick. Paste the link to the video, then add a little bit about your learning goals. Select your grade level and the number of questions that you’d like the chatbot to ask, then click Launch. Instead of passively watching, students are engaging, asking questions, summarizing ideas, and getting instant feedback as they go. So it transforms a typical video into an interactive learning space, where students are thinking with the video instead of just sitting through it. On the teacher dashboard side of Spaces, I can review every single student’s interaction with the chatbots, which really helps me determine their degree of understanding. Plus, if you click on the Groups button, the platform will also sort the class into groups based on their level of participation and comprehension. I hope that you and your students enjoy trying out Video Explorer. If you use SchoolAI or something similar, let us know in the comments. Thanks for watching. Bye.

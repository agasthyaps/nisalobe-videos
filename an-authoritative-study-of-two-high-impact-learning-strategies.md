# An Authoritative Study of Two High-Impact Learning Strategies

> To boost long-term retention, research shows that retrieval practice—using quizzes and flash cards, for example—and spacing learning sessions over time can make a dramatic difference.

## Transcript

Narrator: Learning scientists agree: Retrieval practice and spacing are two of the most effective strategies to drive long-term retention. That’s also the main conclusion of an authoritative 2022 review spanning hundreds of studies on the topic. In the review, researchers explained that studying something twice in a row is not nearly as effective as studying it once—and then following up with retrieval practices like quizzes, summaries from memory, or flash cards. So—students should think of learning as a kind of mental fitness routine. Instead of trying to master material all at once, they should regularly practice recalling the material from memory and then space out learning sessions over time. In one 2015 study, third-grade students who were learning about the sun either studied the material twice, or studied it once and then answered questions. It’s such a simple change. But the students who studied and then answered practice questions scored a whopping 34 percentage points higher than their counterparts. Meanwhile, spacing learning sessions across time is much more effective than studying the same amount of material closer together in time. In a 2021 study, researchers asked two groups of middle school students to solve a dozen math problems. The first group solved four problems per session spread out over three weeks. The second group solved all 12 problems on the same day. Compared to their single-session counterparts, the students who had spread-out sessions scored 21 percentage points higher on a follow-up math test. Memorizing content without any follow-up is a surefire way to forget it, the research shows. For foundational concepts, in particular, preplan your schedule so that you can regularly revisit the material. And the more challenging or novel the information, the more often you want to expose students to it.

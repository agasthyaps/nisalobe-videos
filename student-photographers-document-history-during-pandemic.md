Students in Wendy McElfish’s photography class studied the work of Dorothea Lange before embarking upon a photography assignment of their own , with thematic prompts. Teacher Danielle Sharp adapted McElfish’s lessons into a slide presentation, “ Photography as Witness .”

## Transcript

Wendy: This project started when I was looking for an assignment at the beginning of distance learning. I wanted it to be something that wasn’t too hard for these kids, but was also meaningful. I started looking around at my town, and I saw these long lines outside grocery stores, and I had these flashbacks to photos I’d seen from the Great Depression, and photos from Dorothea Lange. The work she did was simple but powerful. She took photos of what was really happening, the poverty, the sadness. So this became the jumping off point for me. I told them, “Guys, we’re not going to write a report on this. I want you to look at these photos and then create.” We are living history. This is the time for you to document for future generations to see.” I had the students take a number of photos with a specific prompt. Life outside your door. Through a window. My different life inside. And porch photos of your family. I had the students edit in black and white, because I wanted to emulate the photos of the Great Depression. I told them, “I want you to shoot from your soul.” I had students who had barely done any work all through the year, and then when I gave this assignment, they were the ones that turned in the most powerful photos. There was so much emotion, and maybe they just didn’t have the means to do it through writing, but they were able to do it through their phone. This assignment started to take off and get a life of its own after I posted it to a Facebook photography group for high school teachers. Next thing I know, all these teachers are using it, telling me it’s so relevant to their students. Some of the students’ photos were really positive, family time together. Others were very dark, and you can see these kids were having a hard time with what was going on. Our jobs as teachers of the visual arts is to bring out that emotion. A lot of kids aren’t good writers, but they have an eye, they have a voice, and this voice came through so clearly in these photos. This medium is where kids can shine and they can show the world, this is what I see~ I was here~ I matter.

## Article

Fourth-grade teacher Katie Giordano began working with arts educator Jocelyn Greene from Child’s Play NY to start bringing theater and improvisation games into her classroom more than four years ago. “I always had this vision of what I wanted my classroom to look and sound and feel like, but I didn’t necessarily have the tools, especially with the arts,” says Giordano. And now, she says, “it has completely transformed my teaching.” Giordano uses the games throughout the day, in a variety of subjects.

She may start her morning meeting with a game, use another to transition to math, and later in the day have students act out characters from the class’s novel study. Because the games are integrated with content the class is already studying, playing them bolsters academics, but that’s not all: “Theater games really touch on so many different skills,” she explains. “You are getting kids to work together and collaborate, be flexible, compromise.

And then independently, kids are getting up and they’re taking risks and they’re being brave. And as an audience, the whole community is supporting one another.” Seventh-grade drama and movement teacher Todd Rollé has been tuned in to the benefits of theater and improvisation games in his middle school classroom for years. “They provide a space for teachers and students to journey together.

The goal is that (students) grow more present, less armored, and more comfortable in their own skins.” He notes that teachers have to be on board and willing to play as well. “Part of the reason trust gets built is because I participate alongside them. I risk alongside them.

I’m vulnerable alongside them… And sometimes I feel nervous alongside them, too. And that is so important.” To learn more about theater games that support learning, build classroom community, and develop social and emotional skills for students, check out the many articles that Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene has written for Edutopia.

## Transcript

Katie Giordano: Find seven elbows.

Class: OK, one, two.

Katie Giordano: I always had this vision of what I wanted my classroom to look and sound and feel like, but I didn’t necessarily have the tools, especially in dealing with the arts. You got it. Great job. So about four years ago, I started to do integrated theater work in my classroom, and it has completely transformed my teaching. We can start in morning meeting with a theater game, something really silly. And then when I get to the academic portion of our day where it might be reading or writing or science or history or math, I’m then turn keying that same game to make it fit the content that we’re studying.

Class: Lights, camera, action.

Katie Giordano: Theater games really touch on so many different skills. You are getting kids to work together and collaborate, be flexible, compromise. And then independently kids are getting up and they’re taking risks and they’re being brave.

Student: So he looked everywhere and finally found a hot dog sitting on that.

Student: So in the end he found the hot dog and ate it.

Katie Giordano: And as an audience, the whole community is supporting one another. And it’s really helpful to, in a fun, low-stakes environment, play around with ideas like story elements or leads or word choice.

Class: Good job, guys.

Jocelyn Greene: I think that theater games have an incredible impact on a classroom community because they really foster a sense of belonging.

Student: Elephant Boo Boo Bah. Todd A.

Rolle: And theater’s all about this is what we make together. Like, “Hey, we did that. There was some harmony in what we did and we worked off of each other.” Student: Don’t you care about me?

Student: Every time. Todd A.

Rolle: And that’s what theater and improv provide. They provide a space for teachers and students to journey together and to make that safe space together. I am trying to win a race. Part of the reason trust gets built is because I participate alongside them, I risk alongside them, I’m vulnerable alongside them, I get stuck alongside them. And that is so important. I mean, the goal is that they grow more present, less armored, and more comfortable in their own skins.

Student: It’s the power to walk through anything.

Jocelyn Greene: Theater games are also just plain fun. Of course, you’re going to have the rigors of what you’re studying and all the things you need to get through. But really to be able to infuse even as a simple brain break games where you’re getting the kids laughing and playing, then you have them right where you want them for the learning.

Sammi Priti: Because first grade tends to be so content-oriented and so structured, we often lose a little bit of that joy. And I think that was really amazing to see. They were letting themselves go and enjoying. And I myself was like, “This is so amazing. I can’t believe the things that are coming out of your brain and the things that you’re saying.” Student: I know you really like cats, so it’s a magical cat and you can talk to it.

Sammi Priti: They really were listening to each other and were interested because it was so fun.

Student: Hello.

Jocelyn Greene: Oh, hello. It’s active listening, turn taking, and then working memory to hold on to and remember what it is that they’re supposed to be doing consistently.

Student: And what are you doing?

Student: Flying a kite.

Jocelyn Greene: It’s also just a wonderful way to let kids feel seen and heard in their classroom.

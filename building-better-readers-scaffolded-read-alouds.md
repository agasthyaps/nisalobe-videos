## Article

In Brooklyn, an elementary school called P.S. 249, the Caton School, has a 15-to-20-minute block of daily read-aloud time in every classroom, kindergarten through fifth grade. Teachers select a book that’s just above their students’ reading level—and related to the current unit of study in social studies or English language arts—and read it to their class. But this is no typical read aloud.

All along the way, the teachers model good reading skills, as well as how to think critically and analyze text. Every three days, when a new book is introduced, the class reads the back cover, looks at the artwork, and makes predictions. Over the next few days, teachers read small sections of text to the group, stopping every few minutes to pose questions and encourage the students to consider the setting (or characters, or plot elements).

Questions start out asking for basic information about what the students heard and build toward higher-level analytical questions about what might happen in the story or the characters’ motivations. During turn and talks, the students discuss particular passages in pairs while the teacher roams around observing, and each lesson ends with a stop and jot where students answer a prompt using printed copies of the text to find evidence. As the days progress, teachers model less and have students do more of the thinking and analyzing themselves—which empowers students to become more critical and capable readers when they go to read on their own.

## Transcript

Sarah Curtis: John Henry swims better than anyone I know. He crawls like a catfish, blows bubbles like a swamp monster, but he doesn’t swim in the town pool with me.

Sarah Curtis: Read Aloud is an opportunity for students to hear how reading should be done. Those moments where I stop and think, that really sparks ideas in my students’ head of how to do this independently, that’s the whole point. Can they take what we’re doing in Read Aloud and try this in their own book by themselves?

Sarah Curtis: I love that thinking. Great job. Let’s move on.

Elisa Brown: P.S. 249 is a very diverse school, so every classroom has a variety of culturally relevant books. One practice we have every day is Read Aloud. They listen to stories while the teacher is modeling skills and strategies as good readers do.

Sarah Curtis: Read Aloud in our school is an opportunity for students to read texts that are above their grade level, and teachers will model think-alouds that they want the kids to try on their own. We’re hoping to push our readers in their reading skills.

Sarah Curtis: So, we’re going to dive into our Read Aloud today. You guys all have a copy in front of you.

Jayden: I like Read Aloud because you don’t do straight reading. You actually get to pause and think about it.

Sarah Curtis: As you know, when we’re beginning a book… Sarah Curtis: So, today I introduced Freedom Summer . It is a text we use in our historical fiction unit about the segregation period. We start out by posing our teaching point.

Sarah Curtis: Today, we’re going to be focusing on how setting affects other story elements.

Jayden: Setting is where the story takes place. It was 1964, and that affects people’s life.

Sarah Curtis: All right, let’s start with our first page. John Henry Waddle is my best friend. His mama works for my mama. Wait a minute. I feel like that narrator is inside the story, so it must be first person.

Sarah Curtis: Even on the first page, I want to do that think-aloud work that the majority of the room is not going to do on their own. What are those deeper ideas we’re seeing here? Why is the setting so important?

Sarah Curtis: I feel like the fact that John Henry’s mother works for Joe’s mother might cause some big problems in their friendship. So, let’s move on to the next page. We shell butter beans. We sweep the front porch.

Sarah Curtis: Whatever your teaching point is for that read-aloud, that’s when you want to stop and do this work. It won’t be every page. You want to be strategic.

Sarah Curtis: Then we run straight for Fiddler’s Creek. So, I want to think to myself, what story element is the setting affecting here? You’re going to turn and talk to your partner.

Student: Even though they’re different, they still find their own solution to spend time together.

Sarah Curtis: I get to listen in to all these turn and talks and get an informal assessment of what kids are thinking about these texts, how are they responding to this question?

Sarah Curtis: All right, let’s come back together. I heard some of my partnerships talking that the setting is contributing to the problem and the solution because although they can’t play at the town pool, do they have a cool creek to go play in? Totally. So, I want you guys to open up your notebooks and we’re going to answer the question, how is the setting important to the story? You can say the setting is important because it affects, develops, creates, shows.

Sarah Curtis: So, the stop and jots are to do that final thinking work.

Jamal: The setting was really important in this book because the white kid and the black kid couldn’t do as much stuff together.

Student: During 1960, people of color were not allowed to pool in the ice cream shops or any other places. So, Joe finds alternative ways to help.

Sarah Curtis: I want the kids to see reading can be fun. I’m interested. If I’m not excited about it, who’s going to be excited about it with me? You know, I’ll have a kid that comes up to me after Freedom Summer and say, I want to learn more and I love to see that. We want to spark kids’ interest and love of reading.

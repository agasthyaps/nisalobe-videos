## Transcript

Roberta: Every student walks through the door wanting to feel valued. Every child deserves to have at least one adult in this building who knows them by name. We want a hundred percent of our students to feel connected to a teacher in our building and that’s our goal. It was just a matter of how do we measure this? Early in the year, we conduct a teacher-student-connection poster activity so that we can determine which students we’ve connected with and which students we need to work toward connecting with.

Teacher: Delaney is allergic to red food dye.

Teacher: Yeah.

Teacher: And she also has a pond that she swims in.

Roberta: We take their whole roster of students, we put it up on a wall, and we ask teachers to go through by name and face, “Yep, I know this one, this one, this one.” Teacher: Know them all?

Chris: All by name and face. I think that was a team goal by the end of the second week.

Teacher: What?!

Chris: Yeah.

Teacher: End of week two?

Chris: The activity was based around how well do you know your students, just through the simple, you know, adding a check mark next to the kid’s name that you know them by name and face, and then the other categories, academic status, and then the more in-depth personal story about them.

Chris: She’s one that slips under the radar though. She is pretty quiet.

Chris: You look at a lot of kids and you go, “Hey, this student has one check mark. I know them by name and face, but other than that I don’t know where they’re at academically. I don’t know anything about their personal life.” It’s probably harder for them to feel valued in a learning environment without that connection to the teacher. So, to me, that’s what this was all about, a reflective process. How well are we getting to know our kids?

Teacher: And, so, you don’t get to know those students.

Teacher: The stones in the river. That’s what I like to call them.

Teacher: Right.

Teacher: They’re just letting the water wash over them. We’ve got to go pick up that stone, turn it over.

Roberta: We want them to reflect and then it’s time to develop an action plan. What are we going to do to make sure that these students are taken care of?

Teacher: We have personal conversations with our students in the hallways during passing time.

Teacher: We also do things like “Thumbs Up Thursdays” or “Feel Good Fridays” and we just take a few seconds to have kids share things that they’re proud of.

Chris: To get to know the kids a little bit better on a personal level, just asking them a simple question as they come in the door. Example, last week I started off by just asking kids what their favorite food or fruit was. And then those questions can get deeper to try and get, you know, a little more personal with them.

Chris: Winter.

Student: Winter.

Chris: Winter?

Student: Summer.

Chris: What is it? Summer?

Student: Yeah.

Chris: Nice.

Student: Fall.

Chris: The students here should be seen as people and not just pupils. The more valued they are for their individuality the more successful they’re going to be in the classroom, the more risks they’re going to be willing to take. And that’s awesome.

Roberta: We have seen a huge increase in our students’ connection to school, with their connection to the teachers, and I think that’s probably the most joy teachers have in their profession. Then the real work can begin.

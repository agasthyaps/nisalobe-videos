At Boston Latin School, ELA teacher Mary Dibinga’s high school students debate about the merits of different parts of speech, an activity developed by Boston Debate League as part of their Debate-Inspired Classrooms program .

## Transcript

Mary Dibinga: So today we’re going to have a debate. Well, tomorrow we’re going to have a debate; today we’re going to get ready. And our debate is going to be about which part of speech is the best. Which is a ridiculous question, right?

Dibinga: The debate’s a parts-of-speech debate. It’s the first time in the year that I really work with students on grammar.

Dibinga: This is going to help us look at what is actually the purpose of each of the parts of speech and how are they different from each other?

Dibinga: I, as a teacher, could stand up in front of the class and go over the definitions of things, but I usually lose everybody. No one, no one is engaged in my explanations of grammar.

Dibinga: Group one here is going to argue that adjectives are the best. So you’re group one.

Dibinga: When I do it this way, I set up a debate and students are in teams, and I have the different parts of speech represented.

Dibinga: Group three is going to argue that it’s actually verbs… Dibinga: And each team has to defend one of those parts of speech is the best.

Dibinga: Somebody has to give an opening speech.

Dibinga: And I am very open with them from the beginning that this is a ridiculous debate. But the reason we’re debating it is in order to make an argument that an adverb is better than a noun. I actually have to understand what an adverb does, and I have to understand what a noun does.

Dibinga: Group six is actually going to judge the debate.

Dibinga: When I first started doing the debates, I thought I had to judge them as the teacher, and that’s what the students are expecting, that I’m going to judge, but I don’t really care who wins. I care about how the students are learning. I care about how they’re engaging with the material, and I care about giving individual feedback to my students.

Dibinga: If you’re the opening speaker, you’re going to come in tomorrow with your speech all ready to go. If you are a question-asker, you need to write six questions that you’re going to ask.

Dibinga: I have fairly large classes—I tend to have classes of 31. I need a lot of roles if everybody is going to be engaged in this debate.

Dibinga: Decide within your team who’s going to do which role. Every role has a homework assignment.

Male Student: So we should find the most, like, engaging adverbs there are.

Female Student: You have to prepare what questions you might get asked, so you know how to respond.

Female Student: That’s for homework.

Dibinga: Make sure any outside resources you bring in need to be cited. You know, make sure you’re within your times. You turn in the homework assignment and we’re ready! I’m excited. I can’t wait.

Dibinga: I see some competitors here who don’t even want to stop getting ready, you got big plans. We are going to start pretty quickly. You have a very capable panel of judges who’s going to run the show today. Good. Let’s start!

Female Student: Every sentence that you will hear today will have a verb in it. That is because they’re without a doubt the most important—and therefore best—part of speech.

Male Student: Why are verbs more important than nouns?

Female Student: Because they can stand alone by themselves, and you can just make complete sentences and they make sense and they get straight to the point.

Female Student: Adjectives are surely the best. A sentence cleaned of adjectives is bland and flavorless.

Dibinga: During the debate, while the student is talking, I’m looking at the written work that they turned in, to prepare. What I’m looking for is, can I see from the prep that they put some thought into what they were doing ahead of time and how they’re understanding the material?

Female Student: So we just believe that without nouns, the sentences wouldn’t really be tied together and there wouldn’t be a subject.

Dibinga: It’s not so important whether their speeches are great. That’s not the goal of the activity. It’s an activity that’s supposed to help their understanding of the content.

Female Student: But it’s not possible to have a complete functioning sentence without the verb. So considering all we say today, verbs are definitely the best parts of speech and you should choose us.

Kayle: Even though it wasn’t, like, an interesting topic per se, it was still interesting to see the evidence and information other groups came up with and how they use it to defend themselves in thinking that their parts of speech was the best.

Dibinga: I’m not using these strategies to try to build better debaters. I’m using these strategies to try to build a better English class, and that’s always going to come first.

Female Student: Adverbs can stand alone and single-handedly make a story better as the best part of any writing piece. Thank you, judges.

Male Student: Her closing statement was, like, really good. It was kind of long, but, like, it was pretty good.

Male Student: Group A is the winner.

Dibinga: Group A!

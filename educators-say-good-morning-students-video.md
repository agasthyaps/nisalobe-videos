Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, small humans! It is– gosh, what day is it? Let me check. Just wanted to say good morning, let you guys know, again, that we really miss ya’ll. Can you give me an elbow greeting? Good morning, Elliott. I’m excited to see you. It’s kind of cold and I’m outside, because I need fresh air. I’m sporting my soon-to-be six-year-old daughter’s Frozen headphones. I miss seeing your happy faces today, I hope that you’re enjoying a day that you get to stay at home and use your computer to do school. I know things have been a little like a roller coaster ride with ups and downs lately. I know that this is not like regular school, right? Feel free to do school in our jammies, I guess. That’s basically the whole advantage to e-learning. It’s PJ day, so I’m in my jammies. I hope you are, too. And with me today is Thomas O’Malley. Today we have some really fun and exciting activities for you, isn’t that right, Spike? Some of our friends from the classroom also really miss you guys. So, let me show you. Yep, our reading buddies. Oh, she’s starting to look sad, because she miss you. But you know what? They’re really going to come back soon. I promise you. I miss nobody groaning at my puns! I miss you all! I miss single one of you. This has been a lot. This is a whole new process for us. This is a brand-new way of teaching for me and I’m sure that this is a brand-new way of learning for you. So, we’re going to be very patient with each other. Take care of yourselves. Please, please, I cannot stress enough. You are wonderful and I can’t wait to see you again. Hopefully, you guys are staying busy, staying active. Make sure you get some exercise. I’ll see you in a bit. Take care.

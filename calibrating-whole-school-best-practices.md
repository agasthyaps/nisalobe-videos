# Calibrating Best Practices Across a Whole School

> This school has identified core instructional practices and conducts regular walk-throughs for teachers to observe their peers’ lessons—then designs targeted professional development so every classroom can get aligned.

## Article

At Amana Academy , a K–8 EL Education network school in Alpharetta, Georgia, staff walk-throughs are key to bringing all teachers and classrooms into alignment around their North Stars—schoolwide practices that are fundamental for student success. These include having a learning target for each lesson, asking students to grapple with concepts, doing checks for understanding, posting anchor charts, and using consistent discussion protocols. Throughout the school year, teachers are on different parts of the spectrum of implementation—some may be novices and just encountering these core practices, while others are veterans who can model the practices for other teachers.

So seven to 10 times each year, a dedicated team of trained staff conducts walk-throughs, where they observe 75 percent of all classrooms over two or three days, for 15 minutes per classroom. The team starts with a rubric and then uses a grading sheet when observing to see how faithfully teachers are implementing the North Star elements. Were the indicators evident, somewhat evident, not evident, or not applicable?

At the end of the schoolwide observation period, the team analyzes its data. If less than 80 percent of teachers are implementing a particular element well, then it is an area for growth and professional development. A letter goes out to teachers after the walk-through, sharing the data with them, along with “stars and stairs”—areas where everyone excelled (the stars) and areas where teachers could use some additional support (the stairs).

This whole-school approach ensures that no teacher feels singled out, allows them to understand why a particular skill is being worked on, and helps with buy-in for professional development. Throughout the year, the school sees regular growth with all its North Star indicators, so that by the end of the year, everyone is achieving at least 80 percent for several of the indicators.

## Transcript

Jean-Jacques Credi: The biggest impact of walk-throughs is that our students are getting a common experience from grade level to grade level, from classroom to classroom, and it helps us keep a grasp on the highest-leveraged practices that we want to see happening across the school. We know that this process is effective and it makes teachers excellent teachers.

Mona Hussain: When I asked one of the students what is exactly the learning jar, what are you doing? She was able to explain it to me.

Tiffany Everett: And they know what’s coming up in the lessons. At Amana, the same way that we want students feeling successful, we want teachers to feel like there is a path for success for them.

Mona Hussain: The walk-through is like a quick check-in. What do we need to do differently to support the teachers, to support the students? Are the systems in place working? Jean-Jacques Credi: We have core practices that we’re looking for, and we go and see how ubiquitous is this practice happening across the school, and we share that data with the teachers. It’s not direct feedback for individual teachers, it’s really about how are we advancing as a school.

Tiffany Everett: All right, guys, so this is one of the final walk-throughs for this school year, so I want to make sure before we go into the classroom that we calibrate. So we’re going to be looking at the North Star indicators today. The Instructional North Star is how we approach instruction at Amana. The key components are learning targets, checks for understanding, grappling, discussion protocols, and then anchor charts. So when we’re walking through, we use the Instructional North Star Rubric as our guide. So we’re ready? We are going to start in second grade.

Lydia Lombardi: I’m going to pick a student to read the problem. Does everyone have their packet out? We’re on the first page. We’re up here.

Tiffany Everett: We spend 10 to 15 minutes in each classroom, talking to the students, looking at work samples.

Lydia Lombardi: Nesma, can you read the problem for us? Thank you. No classroom is perfect, right? So you want them to see some of the struggles. I get to grow as a teacher, you know, I get to see what areas I need to improve on.

Tiffany Everett: Everybody has their own grading sheet, and they’re looking at those North Star indicators. Was it Evident, Somewhat Evident, Not Evident, or Not Applicable? Then we step out in the hallway, and we calibrate again based on what we saw in that classroom. So one of the examples was before she started that discussion protocol, she ensured that all students had the proper paper that they needed.

Teacher: And even when she didn’t see someone, she’s asked intentionally.

Teacher: Yep, she had the equity sticks.

Teacher: She had the equity sticks.

Tiffany Everett: All right, guys, we’re going up to eighth grade. In the eighth grade classroom, the students were required to teach the lesson.

Student: The number in front of the reactants is called a coefficient, and that shows how many molecules.

Tiffany Everett: If you’re implementing the North Star correctly, the students talk about what’s happening in the classroom.

Teacher: Any other questions for them?

Teacher: I even saw some kids writing some things as they were listening to the presentation. They were gaining something from it, and so they were actively, you know, hearing what the presenters had to say.

Teacher: They had to collaborate with two other people to create that presentation. So… evidence.

Tiffany Everett: After we complete the walk-through, we work on a walk-through letter. The letter goes to all teachers. They understand that this is not individualized feedback. This is schoolwide feedback. As a school, what do we need to do to move the needle forward?

Tiffany Everett: Congratulations. We have reached the point where 100 percent of our teachers are writing learning targets, and they’re posted on the boards. So we’re starting with the growth. But the area that I want to spend most time talking about is that STAIR. So STAIRs are things that they did amazingly well across every classroom. And then STAIRs are the areas that we saw not evident. If less than 80 percent of the teachers are performing on that indicator, then we do a schoolwide PD on it.

Teacher: We have an urgency to end strong. We must grow in discussion protocols by the end of the year.

Mona Hussain: The things that I appreciate when they do the letter is very database. Eighty percent of teachers are doing this, or 20 percent of teachers are not doing this. So they’re not just saying based off their feelings.

Teacher: It’s all right. We got it.

Tiffany Everett: So it’s a wrap for the year.

Teacher: Thank you.

Tiffany Everett: Thank you, guys. Jean-Jacques Credi: Because we do walk-throughs, everybody’s contributing to the improvement of the school and the delivery of our instructional model and helping to support our children.

Tiffany Everett: If the teachers are using the Instructional North Star, students grow, and they become proficient in their learning. And when we see it happening, kids thrive well beyond our doors.

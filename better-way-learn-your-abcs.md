## Article

Making connections between letters and sounds is a crucial skill that sets the stage for reading—and so much more. To dig deeper into the findings cited in the video, read Linn Damsgaard et al.’s 2022 study on the effects of embodied learning on children’s prereading and word-reading skills.

## Transcript

Narrator: One of the foundational skills early readers learn is matching a letter to its corresponding sound. To get a kid to understand that a plosive C makes the sound as in car , teachers often use pictures as scaffolds or have children write the letter repeatedly while making the matching sound. But a new study suggests that this crucial skill—which sets the stage for decoding, blending, and eventually word recognition—is much more effectively learned when whole-body movements are integrated into lessons. In the study, 5- and 6-year-olds spent 90 minutes over the course of eight weeks practicing movements corresponding to each letter of the alphabet. Kids moved like a snake as they hissed the sibilant sss sound or quickly snapped their body into the shape of a Y and paired the movement with the yuh sound. Other groups of students in the study made hand gestures while sounding out words—or sounded out letters without any movement while reading along at their desks. The researchers found that whole-body movement improved students’ ability to recall letter-sound pairings and doubled their ability to recognize hard-to-learn sounds—like the difference between the C in cat and sauce —compared with students who read from their desks. Whole-body movement also outperformed hand gestures by 30 percent. So if you’re working on letter-sound pairings this year, it might be a good idea to get kids up and out of their chairs. The silliness that ensues can have a profound effect on the future readers your students become.

## Article

This video is part of our series on rapid resets , tools for de-escalation that can help teachers and students build resilience, calm their nervous systems, and bring their thinking brains back online. Special thanks to Resources for Resilience , an organization in Asheville, North Carolina, that trains educators in how to use these tools for themselves and with their students.

## Transcript

Leigh: Pushing is another great rapid reset that we use with students, and it’s one of their favorites.

Leigh: We might go up the hall in line and we might stop and I would say, “We’re getting a little rowdy. Okay, everybody, let’s push against the wall.” And everybody did it. Then it became the norm.

Leigh: I had a student, he was having a very difficult time. I could just see it building. So I taught him the pushing against the wall. That’s the one he liked the very, very most.

Leigh: And then the most wonderful thing happened. Other students who saw him would just come up beside him and say, “Can I push with you? I’m here with you.” Leigh: And he would say, “Yes, I could use a friend.” Leigh: I talk through it with them. “What are you feeling in your body now as you have pushed?” Leigh: And at first, young children don’t necessarily have the verbiage for that, or the ability to express those sensations, but over time, they begin to build that vocabulary and then they’re able to express how they’re feeling. “I’m breathing easier. I can feel my shoulders relax.”

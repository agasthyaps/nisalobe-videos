# New Studies Link the Arts to Crucial Cognitive Skills

> What happens to our brains ‘on art’? New studies—often backed by brain imaging technology—are beginning to dial in on the answers.

## Article

New research reveals that the arts may prime our neural circuitry for a broad range of activities, boosting crucial cognitive and social skills like spoken and written language, focus, self-control, and empathy. In a 2016 study , for example, T. Christina Zhao and Patricia Kuhl demonstrated that babies exposed to simple melodies in a social setting developed a greater sensitivity to the rhythms of spoken language.

More surprisingly, they noted, the processing of music was traced not just to the auditory cortex of the infants, but to the prefrontal cortex as well—the seat of higher-order cognitive faculties like attention and self-regulation. “We can see that the babies who have been through the music experience have greater abilities to…hold attention when that’s important, and to switch attention when it’s appropriate to switch,” Kuhl explained in a TED talk . “In other words, music is affecting executive function.” A 2019 study reached similar conclusions with professional musicians, finding that “executive attention is more efficient in musicians than non-musicians,” and improves as musical training progresses.

But those weren’t the only surprises in store for researchers. A major 2019 study tracked over 10,000 students in Texas as they participated in arts programs, concluding that they performed better on state writing tests, were better behaved, had more compassion for fellow students, and were more engaged in school. And a 2018 study showed that drawing had a dramatic effect on memory, outperforming writing, visualizing, and other retention techniques.

## Transcript

Narrator: It’s easy to forget that drawing, music, and dancing are ancient forms of expression. They were present in our earliest communities, even when, as a species, we had almost no margin for error. So, what happens to our brains on art? Why do we engage in it at all? New studies reveal that the arts may prime our neural circuitry for a much broader range of activities, boosting crucial cognitive and social functions like focus, spoken and written language, self-control, and empathy. In 2016, for example, researchers exposed babies to simple melodies and found that it made them more sensitive to the underlying rhythms of spoken language. Brain scans revealed powerful responses in the auditory cortex of the infants, of course, but also recorded greater activation in the prefrontal cortex, the seat of executive functions like attention and self-control, linking music to a set of cognitive skills that are amongst the most reliable predictors of success in school and in life. A 2019 study found similar results in adult musicians. But those weren’t the only surprises in store for researchers. A high-quality 2019 study tracked over 10,000 students as they danced, performed in plays, or took part in music and visual arts programs. In addition to performing better on writing tests, researchers concluded they were better behaved, had great compassion for others, and were more engaged in school. And there was excellent news in the visual arts, too. A 2018 study found that drawing what you’re learning is far superior to writing. And also beats out other techniques like visualizing, even if you’re just producing simple sketches. So, asking your students to draw as they compose stories, or learn about cells or solar systems, should pay big dividends in the end. The idea that the arts are merely extracurriculars, while deeply ingrained, is also bunk. Increasingly, the research shows that the arts are powerful tools for making sense of the world, not so terribly different from, say, mathematics or the written word.

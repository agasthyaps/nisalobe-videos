## Transcript

Hello Cooper, Bailey, long time no see, Miss Kayla. I use a technique called TUMS at the door, to greet my students in a way that is personal, quick and efficient. I do it at the door, because it helps build that relationship with each student individually, without having to go from desk to desk to desk. It’s T for touch. Hi, Damian, you want a hug today? Since touch is not comfortable for everybody, I give them the option of either a high five, a handshake, a hug or a fist bump. Emily. U is for use their name (in a positive way). What’s up, Cody? They know that I know who they are. Marco. And they’re not just some random kid out of my long list of students. When you make eye contact with them, you show that you truly care about what they’re saying, or that they’re there. And S is for smile, because smiling is a good way to start off your day. It sets you up for a positive lesson. TUMS at the door is a way for me to build relationships with my students and a way for them to be welcomed into my classroom every day.

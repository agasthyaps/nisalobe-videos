A 2020 study that analyzed decades of research found that writing “reliably enhanced learning” across all grade levels and multiple subjects, including science, social studies, and math. Strategies like “I Wonder” journals and low-stakes writing prompts can encourage students to write in any classroom.

## Transcript

Narrator: Answering multiple-choice or short-answer questions can assist with factual recall. But expository writing requires students to revisit the raw materials of learning and make their own meaning. And the benefits aren’t limited to English classes. A 2020 study that analyzed decades of research found that writing reliably enhanced learning across all grade levels, and multiple subjects, including science, social studies and math. The reason, the process of writing improves a student’s ability to recall information, make new connections between different concepts, and synthesize information in novel ways. Make no mistake, writing is challenging, and many students struggle to get their thoughts down on paper. That difficulty is part of what makes it so valuable. To keep your students motivated, use low-stakes methods that deemphasize grading, and allow for lots of rough draft thinking. Here are five engaging writing activities to use in any subject. After giving a lesson, as students to write down “I wonder” questions. Wondering prompts students to think outside the box and sets the stage for exploration. Have students create a journal to track their learning and reflect on it. Encourage students to include charts, drawings and graphic organizers as they record their learning journey. Ask questions like, “What do you notice? Can you explain this? What similarities and differences do you see?” These prompts help students think about a topic in an informal, low-stakes way, and provide an entry point to the lesson for everyone. Have students create articles around the topics they’re learning. When students explain concepts to real-world audiences, they connect their learning to real-world impacts, and fill in gaps in their own knowledge. Create imaginative scenarios like, “Imagine a create that could survive in our local river.” Students can write a story that combines science concepts with creative storytelling, which activates multiple regions of the brain, and allows them to engage with the material in a more personal way.

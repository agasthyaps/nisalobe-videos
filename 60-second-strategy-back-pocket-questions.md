When the clock is ticking down before the bell rings, it’s easy for a classroom to get a bit out of control. Students may get up, start talking, and even spill into the hallway. Witnessing this, middle school Spanish teacher Jamie Midyette wanted to find a solution to keep her students engaged until the very last second—so in her classes at Albert Hill Middle School in Richmond, Virginia, she started implementing a strategy called back pocket questions .

Back pocket questions can be just that—questions a teacher has written on index cards that they can literally keep in their pocket. Midyette chooses to use her interactive whiteboard, often projecting sentences in Spanish with a blank for a missing word. The prompts may relate to the current unit or they can be review, and they can be pulled from any subject area.

In Midyette’s class, a student volunteer flips through cards with students’ names on them and randomly selects one. Midyette asks that student if they would like to respond. If they say yes, they read the full sentence out loud and fill in the blank on the fly.

As a reward for participating, Midyette offers them a sticker and asks their fellow students to celebrate their work by snapping their fingers. Then the student volunteer selects the next name. A flexible closing activity can fill as much or as little time as you have—with this one, in just a minute or two several students will get the opportunity to practice their vocabulary, and many others will benefit by listening.

Crucially, using back pocket questions contributes to a classroom environment in which everyone is seated and still learning until the bell signals that it’s truly time to go. The back pocket questions activity originated from Doug Lemov’s book Teach Like a Champion . The sentences on the interactive whiteboard originate from Simon’s Cat , by Simon Tofield, and are adapted from French teacher Allison Litten of Hartford High School in Hartford, Vermont.

## Transcript

Jamie Midyette: (speaking in Spanish) Jamie Midyette: Back pocket questions are an activity for the end of class, when you’ve finished your lesson and the bell’s about to ring, but you still have a little bit of time. These are questions that you could just pull out of your back pocket and still utilize that time with your students in a meaningful way. I choose to do it by projecting the sentence onto the smart board. They could be questions about the unit that you’re currently studying, they could be review questions. And then my student volunteer chooses the first name.

Student: Markey.

Jamie Midyette: And then I ask that person if they want to respond to the question that I have projected.

Jamie Midyette: (speaking in Spanish) Jamie Midyette: Then they answer the question by filling in the blank.

Jamie Midyette: [speaking in Spanish] Morgan.

Jamie Midyette: They’re really showing off their knowledge and getting extra repetitions.

Jamie Midyette: I think that every teacher would benefit from this because it prevents the students from standing up and starting to spill out into the hallway. It maintains the students’ focus throughout the entire class period. It encourages them to be seated and still learning.

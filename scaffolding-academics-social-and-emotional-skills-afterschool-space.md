## Transcript

Linda: There’s a very substantial body of research that shows that when you develop executive function, self-regulation and focus, academic outcomes improve tremendously. It’s a brilliant stroke to use the afterschool time to do creative and interesting things and learn social and emotional skills, which they can carry back into the school.

Bridget: When Wings first started, we saw the afterschool space as a real unique opportunity. They had three hours a day of just enjoying, engaging, having fun. And we thought that that was the perfect place to bring in social and emotional learning. A lot of kids struggle in the classroom with challenges that get in their way that have nothing to do with cognitive ability. If they learn skills to control themselves, to focus, automatically they’re beginning to develop academic skills at a faster rate, because now they’re actually focused and can sit still and can learn. We have learning objectives that we weave into every week of the program.

Jaquan: This week’s SE lesson is R and R, which is to reset and relax.

Keyasia: You reset, identify the problem or what’s making you upset or what’s making you emotionally hijacked, and then you calm yourself down. We did a play, because we noticed that is something our kids, they always like to see us be silly and be fun.

Jaquan: Gee, I cannot wait for school tomorrow.

Keyasia: He forgot to set his alarm clock.

Children: Just reset and relax, bruh.

Keyasia: He reset and relaxed. Because he was so happy about school, nothing could bring him down.

Jaquan: Life throws some situations at us where you might be feeling three or four things at one time, but you don’t know how to express it, because no one has ever taught you.

Children: Just reset and relax, bruh.

Jaquan: That’s why I feel like this stuff is very important.

Linda: We learn things that become habits by doing them over and over again, and by having a way to know when we’re going to use them. So these little mantras are giving kids opportunities to practice and reminding them, this is the time to use that skill.

Teacher: Okay, so this is when we need to actually reset and relax and we need to count to ten, okay? One… Jaquan: I feel like, I really build a bond with these kids and they can tell that you’re genuine and you’re truly wanting to help them. That’s when they’ll start implementing and using these techniques and these things that we teach them. “Mr. Hicks says that if I breathe in and out and take a few minutes to myself, I’m going to feel better, so let me try it,” you know? And they do it, and it actually works, and they start– you know, they believe you, so once they believe you and they experience that it actually works, they start doing it more often.

Bridget: In two thousand eleven, we launched a full randomized control trial and we had some statistically significant results around the social and emotional skill development, executive function, and positive results around behavior in the classroom.

Jaquan: I see a kid get upset and I’m like, oh snap. He’s about to break, he’s about to start yelling. And then I look over and he’s like, “Mr. Hicks, do you mind if I go sit over here and just chill out for a second?” and I’m like, whoa, what? Like, that just really happened? Am I dreaming, you know? Makes you feel really good and it just blows your mind.

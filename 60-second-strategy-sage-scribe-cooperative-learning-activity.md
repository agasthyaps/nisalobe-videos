## Article

Sage and Scribe is a cooperative learning activity that gives every student a chance to be both an expert and a learner. In Kait Hudson’s first-grade class at Barbara Morgan STEM Academy in Meridian, Idaho, she uses this simple partner exercise for a variety of academic tasks—today, she’s giving students a chance to practice decomposing a number. After students are paired up, each duo gets a whiteboard, a marker, and an eraser.

One student is the sage and the other a scribe. “The sage is the only one who talks,” Hudson explains—and the scribe has to write down exactly what the sage dictates. “The scribe can clarify, but they can’t build on or help.” When the sage is all done, the scribe has an opportunity to agree or disagree with the sage’s approach and can also offer helpful feedback.

And then they switch roles. “They speak each other’s language,” she says. “Like, I speak ‘teacher.’ I try to speak ‘kid,’ but sometimes they can say it better than I can say it.” Hudson says the activity helps students feel ownership over what they’ve learned.

“This really makes it so they have the chance just to practice, and everybody’s voice is heard and it’s valued.” The strategy can be used in any number of subjects. “I use it a lot with math,” says Hudson, “and I’ll also use it for phonics.” Because it helps students learn to take turns and be good listeners, she’s even used it for more fun, less academic pursuits, like drawing. “I’ll say, ‘Teach a friend how to draw a dog!’” The Sage and Scribe cooperative learning structure was developed by Dr.

## Transcript

Kait Hudson: Raise your hand if you’re an expert or a teacher in our classroom. Sage and Scribe is a great activity to practice being a learner and an expert, right? Today we used Sage and Scribe for decomposing a number to make a 10. When I say go, the first Sage will choose the problem. Everybody needs their whiteboard marker and eraser. The Sage is the only one who talks.

Student: Seven into four and three.

Kait Hudson: And then the scribe would be writing. The scribe can clarify, but they can’t build on or help. When the sage is done, I ask the scribe to agree or disagree and then give feedback. And then they switch. Sometimes we get so stuck on just teaching that we don’t let kids have the ownership that they need. This really makes it so they have the chance just to practice, and everybody’s voice is heard and it’s valued.

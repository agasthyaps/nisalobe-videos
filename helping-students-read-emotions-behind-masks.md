Emotional literacy allows us to understand our feelings and express them. We can teach emotional literacy by using feelings charts, modeling our own management of emotions, and helping students name their emotions and think about their reactions.

Narrator: Emotional literacy, it’s what allows us to understand our feelings and express them accordingly. We can teach emotional literacy using feelings charts, modelling our own management of emotions, and by helping students name their emotions and think about their reactions. Emotional literacy also helps us interpret and process the feelings of others, which is the first step toward developing empathy and working successfully in teams. Context and culture play a role in how feelings are expressed, but you can teach some basic emotions. Joy, sadness, anger, disgust, fear and surprise. And teaching children to pay attention to facial expressions can build crucial emotional literacy skills. That’s harder to do, of course, when we’re all wearing masks, but we can try to read facial expressions from the eyes up. At school, we can help students increase their comfort level with masks, by engaging in some intentional practice. Have a student wearing a mask think of a feeling and try to express it with their face. Then ask the class to guess the emotion. As time goes on, more nuanced feelings can be discussed, expanding students’ emotional vocabulary. With a little bit of effort, students can become experts at reading the facial expressions of people wearing masks, which can help reduce confusion, anxiety and fear in the short term, and build their emotional literacy tool kit for the long term.

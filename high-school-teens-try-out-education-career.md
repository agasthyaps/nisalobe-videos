# Growing Teens Into Teachers

> Running a preschool inside a high school gives students the chance to try out a career in education—and it benefits the teens and tots alike.

## Article

The Career and Technical Education building at Fauquier High School includes classrooms dedicated to skills you might expect: woodworking, cooking, and car maintenance. But enter Nancy Nye’s room, and you’ll encounter students getting a very different kind of hands-on experience: running a fully functioning preschool. Nye’s Early Childhood Education class allows high school students to gain firsthand experience with teaching preschoolers.

The students design and lead lessons, redirect children who aren’t listening, and—perhaps the hardest lesson of all, according to Nye—learn to say “No.” The high school students enrolled in Early Childhood Education have taken a prerequisite class, Child Development, with Nye. Many of them are interested in becoming teachers; others are exploring careers in physical therapy, nursing, or psychology. As Nye notes, “It’s nice for them to get experience now.

You don’t really learn until you’re in the classroom and working with the kids.” Clara, an 11th grader who wants to be a teacher, says, “Seeing how the kids interact with each other, interact with their environment, it really helps me put into perspective what I’m going to be setting myself up for in the future, and it really gets me excited.” The preschoolers are local 3- and 4-year-olds. Parents learn about the program by word of mouth, and they pay a below-market fee that helps cover the cost of materials. At drop-off, the high school students greet their students with hugs and high-fives, setting a positive tone for the school day.

During the first couple of weeks, Nye observes the interactions between the teens and tots and then pairs each high school student with two or three preschool students based on personalities. At the beginning of class, the high school students sit with their assigned preschool students, helping them with activities designed to develop their fine motor skills, like forming shapes and writing their names. Clara notes the ways she’s grown as a teacher and partner to “her” kids: “At the beginning of this year, I was not really sure how to interact with the kids, not really sure what’s the difference between hanging out with them and teaching them.

I feel more confident now.” The high school students also take turns being responsible for the week’s lesson plans. Each week has a designated letter, and one high school student chooses a book to read and a craft to make that connects with that letter. A week dedicated to “L” features a story about a ladybug flying home, and every child makes their own ladybug out of a paper plate.

Clara values the chance to have real responsibility, while also having Nye’s support if she needs help: “She gives a lot of power to us to help the kids. But at the same time, she doesn’t let anything go past her.” The preschool is closed on Fridays to give Nye and the high school students a chance to debrief and to plan for the following week. Students share examples of ways in which both they and their preschool students have grown—as well as ways they would like to improve.

Many of the high school students involved in the preschool go on to participate in Fauquier High School’s Teach for Tomorrow program. Participants intern at local elementary schools, shadowing a teacher at first and then leading their own lessons. At the end of the program, the school district sends each participant a letter with an exciting promise: Once the student finishes their undergraduate education, they will have a job waiting for them in Fauquier County Schools.

Nye notes how important it is to create this pipeline, citing a reality facing Fauquier County and districts around the country: “We need good teachers more than ever. So I just hope that I can guide them into that.”

## Transcript

Student : All right, we‘re going to do one more. Sled. Child : Sled. Student : Sled and kite. Child : Sled bed.

Nancy Nye: At the beginning, some of the high schoolers are very reserved, especially with telling the preschoolers “No.” That is a huge growth for them to be able to say no or redirect them. I think everybody in here is learning, and that is really cool to see. Student : Good job, guys.

Nye: At Fauquier High School, we offer career readiness classes, helping kids get into the workforce and get an idea of what they like to do. We have a program where students get to be the teachers in an in-house preschool. It’s nice for them to get experience now. You don’t really learn until you’re in the classroom and working with the kids. Student : I want to be an elementary school teacher. Seeing how the kids interact with each other, interact with their environment, it really helps me put into perspective what I’m going to be setting myself up for in the future, and it really gets me excited.

Nye: And you have all of your books. When my high school students come in, we discuss what we’re going to be doing that day. Everybody’s going to be responsible for different things. So we make sure that we’re clear on what everybody’s job is that day. And today, Kate, you’re going to do the computer part. And then Clara was going to do Starfall. Then when it’s time, we walk out and we meet the parents and the kids. Everybody, for the most part, is happy; sometimes we have a few tears. Student : Go! Good job.

Nye: Often, we do centers when they come in. A lot of our centers focus on fine motor skills, so they might be working with Play-Doh. They might be working with little blocks. They might be working with the magic pads, so they’re writing names, and then they switch. Student : Good job. Kind of looks like a letter, huh? Child : X? Student : X. Good job. Let’s try and make it.

Nye: I wait a little bit of time before I pair up the high schooler with the preschooler, because I like to get to know the personalities. Student : At the beginning of this year, I was not really sure how to interact with the kids, not really sure what’s the difference between hanging out with them and teaching them. I feel more confident now; I feel like both of them feel really comfortable with me. Student : You have to understand their basics of development. Each kid has a different personality. Sometimes you need to be a little more patient. If they’re not listening, try to just give them another option and get them to what they’re supposed to be doing. After the centers, we’ll go down to the carpet. We’ll do some songs to get some wiggles out. Kids : H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P. Student : And then we do letters of the week, so each teacher is assigned a letter. All right, today we are going to do the letter “L.” Can someone tell me what the letter “L” sounds like again? Oh, nice work. Kid : Lemon. Student : Lemon, good job. Student : It’s up to that teacher to decide what their craft is going to be and what books for each day. Student : Do ladybugs fly? Kids : Yes. Student : Yes. Today we made a ladybug because we’re learning the letter “L.” Student : So I think having designated weeks really helps you feel in control.

Nye: I like to give them a chance to take the lead, and I am trying to step back as time goes by. Student : Point to where you want your spots. Right here. Where else? Ms. Nye helps the high schoolers feel like they are in charge. She gives a lot of power to us to help the kids. But at the same time, she doesn’t let anything go past her.

Nye: I have the magic teacher eyes, right? You see everything that is happening. So I will often see if I feel like they’re handling the situation. But sometimes I’ll step in and say, “Do you need help?” Teachers, you should not be doing all the cleaning. Student : Hey, can you put those… Nye: They can help you. Student : I really have seen the changes throughout all the kids in the class. Most of them are getting more out of their shell.

Nye: Fridays, we do a lot of debriefing, like what went well that week, what we need to work on, what they’ve noticed in their children, how they’ve grown, and how they’ve grown, too.

Student: All the 4-year-olds at my table are getting much better at talking to each other.

Nye: That’s nice.

Student: Conversations.

Nye: Good. I feel that with my high schoolers, too. This is the time of year when that happens. As a teacher, this is the time of year when things start to seem to come together, and then you have to say goodbye. I love teaching. I don’t sugarcoat it. It’s a hard career, and I tell them that, but it’s so rewarding. We need good teachers more than ever. So I just hope that I can guide them into that.

# Building Communication Skills in Science

> By taking an interdisciplinary approach to science class, teachers are able to deepen understanding—and sharpen literacy skills, too.

## Article

At Casco Bay High School in Portland, Maine, Jenny Crowley’s ninth graders are in the midst of a learning expedition called “Questions of Conscience”—a STEM-led, humanities-supported deep dive that focuses on advancements in biology, medicine, and technology; deepens literacy and communication skills in science; and asks bioethical questions like “How can resources be used equitably?” and “Who gets to make decisions around resources and why?” Almost all of the teaching and learning at Casco Bay takes an interdisciplinary approach, like all members in the EL Education network of schools. Says founding teacher Susan McCray, “Expeditions are interdisciplinary because the world is interdisciplinary, right? Everything is interdisciplinary.

Most people don’t explore things in discrete ways.” To prepare students for a high-stakes culminating project at the end, Crowley uses mini bioethical dilemmas to help sharpen students’ discussion skills while deepening their understanding of biology. In a multiday lesson, students create folded paper models to understand the science behind sickle cell disease. By bringing a hands-on activity into her lesson that allows students to explore the mechanics of the disease—and asking students to read accounts from people who have it—Crowley hopes her students will develop a sense of empathy.

In a subsequent class, students read articles about the newest advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and finally they take part in small group discussions pondering the question, “If you or someone you loved had this disease, what are the pros and cons of receiving a brand-new treatment?” Crowley says the role of bioethical dilemmas in her class is to scaffold her students toward a larger discussion, and she uses four or five of them over the course of several weeks so students can practice presenting arguments and build their communication skills in science. “As teachers, we’re trying to make the next generation of students really data literacy–minded, to ask the hard questions and be able to consume scientific information,” Crowley says. “We want our students to be thinking about multiple perspectives and how decisions impact people differently, in different populations.” Find more practices from this school on Edutopia’s Casco Bay High School page .

## Transcript

Student 1: Yeah, we found a cure for the disease, but you can’t get it because it costs so much. Student 2: And you have the disease, but you’re not eligible to get it. Susan McCray: Everything is interdisciplinary. Most people don’t explore things in discrete ways. You need to understand science. You need to understand the impact on society. And then English is always the skill part. You need to read, you need to write effectively, you need to communicate, you need to articulate yourself. When those things are all integrated together, then it makes more sense for kids. Student 4: And hemoglobin slows down. Student 5: I told you that. Susan McCray: Our curriculum is designed around creating what we call expeditions. And expeditions are interdisciplinary. I think you get to far higher rigor and critical thinking if what you’re doing is integrating and looking at the real problem.

Jenny Crowley: We’re going to talk about clinical trials and what that means and how it connects to bioethics, which is the broad topic of questions of conscience. So in this exhibition, there’s really two big questions. What is the role of science and ethics in progress? And how do we communicate scientific information accurately? What do we already know about sickle cell disease? So yesterday’s activity was really building up to what are people living with sickle cell disease experiencing and giving them a background so that they could connect to the human piece of these are humans that are suffering with this disease and there is a possibility for a cure for them or treatment. We’re going to make the normal hemoglobin and then we’ll make the sickle. I asked students to make one model, origami model of normal hemoglobin and what that would look like, the shape. And then I asked them to make a sickled mutated version. Student 7: The non-sickle cell, so it goes through. Student 8: Then the sickle cell can’t go through.

Jenny Crowley: So we’re able to see that there is potential for blood clots. I want them to be able to communicate science in a way that is approachable and that is understandable. So when we use the term ethics, we’re talking about an attempt to define what is good for the individual and for society. The New York Times published a piece around the first commercial patient to receive gene therapy for sickle cell. It’s a twelve-year-old boy. And they do a little bit of a reflection around if they or someone close to them was impacted by sickle cell, would they pursue this treatment? And then to think about pros and cons to that decision. Student 10: It may not always be available since it is very limited. Student 9: Also, if it doesn’t work, you just spent $3.1 million on something that didn’t work.

Jenny Crowley: So today was the first of many biomedical dilemmas in my class. We do maybe or five. Over the course of the next several weeks. We’ll focus on building on each other’s ideas and then do the next one with another skill. Maybe it’s paraphrasing or doing more a synthesis. Student 11: Everyone’s body’s going to react to it differently.

Jenny Crowley: I’m hoping that they’re able to understand the science concepts we’re talking about and to ask the hard questions and be able to consume scientific information. Susan McCray: Our students see the complexity of the world and its issues, and they wrestle with that. And they arrive at new ideas and new questions. Student 11: So I feel like if I had sickle cell, I would get the medicine. But a big con is you don’t know what’s going to happen to you and you …

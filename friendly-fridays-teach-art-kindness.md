## Article

Elementary school teacher Elizabeth Peterson finds that the arts are a perfect way to practice social and emotional skills. Friendly Fridays is a popular strategy she developed as part of her social-emotional artistic learning (SEAL) approach , and she adapted it to work even—and especially—during distance learning . This fun practice brings smiles to kids—and to the recipients of their Friendly Friday creations.

## Transcript

Elizabeth: Let’s welcome our Friendly Friday! It’s time, it’s time! Raise the roof! Are you ready to do some fun creativity? And who’s ready to bring a smile to somebody else? Friendly Fridays is a simple strategy to build relationships, and also promote creativity in the classroom. Students create something friendly for another classmate or another teacher in the building, or in the case of remote learning, someone at home. I was actually surprised at how well it ended up working online. The kids got so much enjoyment out of making something with such a real purpose for someone each and every week. It gives students real opportunities to practice social-emotional skills. So, I usually do one Friendly Friday activity a week, but you can tailor it to your schedule. So, in last week’s class, we actually did two Friendly Friday activities. The first activity was a scavenger hunt.

Elizabeth: I’m going to tell you something that you need to go and get, and we’re going to use these things for our Friendly Friday creation. I want you to get two pieces of paper. Once they have all their materials, they need to then use all of those materials to create something for someone that they’ll see over the weekend. While they were creating their artwork, I played some music that would help them along and keep them motivated. After they finished their creation, I allow them a chance to share.

Student: Well, I made this picture for my dad. And— Elizabeth: I really don’t focus on having students explain what they did. I’ll prompt them to tell me what are they going to do with it, and who are they going to give it to?

Student: Tomorrow’s my sister’s birthday, so I made her this.

Elizabeth: Awesome!

Elizabeth: The second activity was hidden messages. I asked the students get a piece of paper, and then cut it into fourths. We are going to write a friendly message on each piece of paper, and then we’re going to hide them in places for people to find them.

Elizabeth: Who wants to share where they just hid notes?

Student: I hid one in my mom’s drawer with her clothes.

Student: I hid one in the fridge by my dad’s stuff.

Student: I rolled out some toilet paper and put it in and then rolled the toilet paper back up.

Elizabeth: [laughs] That is brilliant! Friendly Fridays helps to really build that idea of kindness and empathy and relationship skills. They can really get to know each other, and appreciate each other as well. It’s a practice that shouldn’t just be done once, and it was kind of nice, but it should really be done in a consistent way.

Student: I like Friendly Friday, because it’s like after a week of hard work, we get a little reward.

Student: It makes me happy! And then I get to make other people happy!

Elizabeth: I love that!

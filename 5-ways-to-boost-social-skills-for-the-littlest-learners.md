## Transcript

Narrator: We now know that soft skills are life skills. By helping students develop strong social awareness and the tools needed to regulate their emotions even in a busy classroom, you can create a focused environment that’s more conducive to learning and supports them in building the foundation they’ll need to succeed in life.

Narrator: Students feel safe when they know what to expect. Make visual posters for daily tasks and routines. Display rules on how to play games with others, or list out positive behaviors expected in the classroom. These visual guides will help students recognize patterns and provide a sense of power and control over the environment for little ones who may not feel that elsewhere.

Narrator: Movement is key to helping young learners focus. It improves metacognition skills and helps kids regulate emotions. Try creating sensory paths in a classroom. Place stickers around the classroom with different exercises like jumping jacks, wall pushing, and squats. When students are having trouble concentrating, have them walk the sticker path and do the movements to work out their wiggles.

Narrator: Giving students a job is a good way to motivate them and help them feel like part of the classroom community. Create unique jobs for your students that change monthly. When positions are assigned, explain why the job is important. It will reinforce their sense of purpose. A student can manage volume control when it gets too loud or be in charge of collecting assignments. Clear roles help them stay engaged and focused while creating a calm learning environment.

Narrator: Sometimes we all need space away from the hustle and bustle to process our emotions. Set up a cool-down corner with an assortment of comforting items like a bean bag, noise-canceling headphones, or a bin filled with stuffed animals. While the classroom is buzzing, a child can choose to go to a safe space. This helps them reset and regulate themselves. You can also post an emotions chart in the calm space to help them identify what they are feeling.

Narrator: Teaching young learners to face challenges with a positive attitude sets them up to be capable problem solvers. If a task is difficult or frustrating, show them it’s OK to ask for support. Modeling communication rooted in a growth mindset encourages kids to be more independent—go from “I can’t do it” to “I’ll keep trying,” or “I can’t tie my shoes” to “Can you help me with tying my shoes?” When students start to see mistakes as learning opportunities and ask for help when they need it, they’ve truly started on a path of lifelong learning.

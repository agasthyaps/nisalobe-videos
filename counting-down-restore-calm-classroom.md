Kaitlyn: My name is Kaitlyn Lawler and I’m a first grade teacher. Here is one of my favorite ways to help kids when they’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. It’s called Count Down to Calm, and you can do it anytime, anywhere. Start with a deep breath in, and out. Look around you and notice five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste, or want to. I use this exercise when one of my students is having a hard time regulating, or with the whole class to help us settle down. I even use it for myself when I’m feeling stressed. Shifting your focus away from worried thoughts to non-threatening things in your immediate surroundings helps your body stop producing stress hormones, and resets your brain. Then you can get back to learning and move on with your day.

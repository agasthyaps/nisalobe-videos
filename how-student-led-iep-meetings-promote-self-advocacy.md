## Article

At Olmsted Falls High School in Ohio, students don’t just attend their annual individualized education program (IEP) meetings—they lead them. For 11th-grader Samson, taking an active role in these conversations has become an important part of growing more independent, both in school and beyond. Samson began attending his IEP meetings in eighth grade and hasn’t missed one since, gradually moving from some participation to a fully student-led model.

“I like being a part of those meetings,” he says. “It lets my voice be heard.” He wants other students to know that having an IEP doesn’t set them apart—it simply means they get support where they need it. Transition coordinator Christen Brabenec works closely with students like Samson as they prepare for these meetings.

Before each IEP conversation, she meets one-on-one with students to help them reflect on their strengths, needs, and goals. These planning sessions are where she uses Charting the LifeCourse , a framework that helps students and educators break goals into concrete steps. “It narrows our focus and gives us actual to-do steps,” Brabenec explains.

“It also gives students talking points: ‘This is what I want. This is what I need.’” During their prep session, Samson and Brabenec identify what’s still helpful and what is no longer necessary—and because he knows his plan, Samson is more likely to ask for help. He sees these gradual shifts as part of building independence.

“We take little steps at a time,” he says. By the time Samson enters his IEP meeting—with his mom, teachers, and principal—he’s ready. He shares his goals, communicates what he needs, and listens as others offer feedback.

It’s exactly what student-led IEPs are designed to do—make sure the conversation centers the student’s voice. Samson’s advice to others is simple: “Don’t be afraid of your voice being heard… People can’t decide things for you. In life, you’ve got to be the one to make your own decisions.” Find more resources on how to implement student-led IEP meetings in this Edutopia article by Angie Chapple, “ How to Foster Student Self-Advocacy in IEP Meetings .”

## Transcript

Staff: Do you agree with Mom’s question about getting a little more help in the writing?

Samson: I do want to be a good writer. I just want to be able to be confident saying, “Wow, this is a great article.” Just because you have an IEP, it doesn’t make you different. It just means there’s just things you need help with. Some kids do, some kids don’t. There’s nothing wrong with that. Samson’s parent: My greatest concern at this time is actually helping him get organized.

Samson: It just used to be my mother who would attend the IEP meetings. I started going every year since eighth grade and I haven’t missed a single meeting since. I like being a part of those meetings. It lets my voice be heard.

Christen Brabenec: We know that once students leave our building and our safety net, that whether it’s employment, college, any setting, they’re going to have to advocate for themselves. You have to gradually build and gradually give students that independence. Students who participate in their IEPs are more likely to seek out resources and use them.

Samson: Ms. Brabenec’s great. She does a really good job of we take little steps at a time.

Christen Brabenec: So where do you want to be after high school graduation?

Samson: I want to try to get a communications degree.

Christen Brabenec: I like to touch base with students before their IEP meetings, and then that’s when we can use some of the Charting the LifeCourse tools. Today, we’re going to use this trajectory tool. It helps you narrow in what you want to do after high school and helps us get there. Charting the LifeCourse is a free set of resources for staff and students to use together. It really narrows our focus and then gives us actual to-do steps. But it also gives them talking points.

Samson: We went over some of our accommodations and she basically asked me on what I want to continue and what I want to stop.

Christen Brabenec: Things that we don’t need to continue is helping with just part-time employment.

Samson: I actually have a job now and I’m doing really good at it.

Christen Brabenec: That’s awesome.

Samson: I want to talk to them about some of my goals and I think it’s going to go really good from here.

Christen Brabenec: All right. Well, welcome to your meeting today. A student-led IEP meeting looks like most of the conversation is being directed and carried by the student.

Samson: When looking at the accommodations, I feel like extended time, they help me reset my focus and energy.

Christen Brabenec: The student’s role is to say, “Here’s how I feel. This IEP encompasses my interest, strengths, and needs, and these are the things that I want moving forward.” Samson: My writing skills aren’t what I want them to be yet.

Staff: We do have ELA lab.

Christen Brabenec: Teachers and even our principal were giving natural feedback, and that was something that Samson was like, “Oh yeah, can we add that?” Again, it’s just making sure that we’re always turning back to the student and saying, “Do you agree with this?” Samson: I need to work on completing assignments and math. Don’t be afraid of your voice being heard because it is you. And if there’s something you disagree with or something you don’t want, don’t be afraid to speak up about it. Because if you don’t, and if you keep just doing the same cycle over and over again, you’re not going to get anywhere. People can’t decide things for you in life. You’ve got to be the one that’s got to make your own decisions. If I just keep doing what I’m doing now, I think eventually down the road, I’m going to be all good by myself.

Christen Brabenec: That’s awesome. I know. I’m so proud of you.

In early childhood classrooms, even everyday routines like cleaning up can become opportunities for play, make-believe, and shared responsibility. In Monster Cleanup, the teacher has a chance to step into character and transform a mundane task into a game that invites laughter, creativity, and teamwork. At The Co-op School in Brooklyn, New York, teacher Laura Scatena-Romero turns cleanup time into a performance for her 4-year-old students.

She plays a grumpy “monster” who hates clean rooms and loves messes. And since children delight in outsmarting a villain, when the monster pretends to fall asleep, that’s the cue. Students leap into action, gathering scattered toys and supplies as quietly and quickly as they can.

Occasionally the monster stirs and wonders, “What is that noise?” or “Are you guys cleaning?” Students freeze in place and insist that no one is ruining the monster’s beloved mess. But once the monster goes back to sleep, the cleaning continues. The pattern repeats until the room is tidy and the kids emerge triumphant.

Through this game, students stay engaged in the chore while learning to follow routines, collaborate with their classmates, and take pride in caring for their environment. “It’s them taking a leadership role of cleaning up and taking care of our classroom and materials,” Scatena-Romero explains. The game also helps build self-regulation skills, as students follow cues and work together toward a shared goal.

By infusing joy and imagination into a classroom task, this cleanup game demonstrates the power of using creative teaching strategies to foster community. For young learners, the opportunity to play while working builds a positive association with responsibility—and shows that even tidying up can be fun.

## Transcript

Laura Scatena-Romero: OK, butterflies. Are you ready to play Monster Cleanup?

Student: Yay. Laura Scatena-Romero: Because we turn cleaning into a game, my students are having fun with each other and playing along with me. It’s them taking a leadership role of cleaning up and taking care of our classroom and our classroom materials.

Student: Owen, you want to help me build something with Zyla?

Student: And I have a really cool special piece over here.

Jocelyn Greene: Monster Cleanup is a great way for kids to play while doing a task. The teacher gets to pretend to be a monster. Laura Scatena-Romero: What’s happening over there?

Student: We’re playing. Laura Scatena-Romero: You’re playing? You’re not cleaning? The first thing I do is I tell them a story. Guess what? I’m the cleanup monster. And you know what I love? A messy room, so don’t clean up for me. I’m just going to take a nap. OK? Do not clean up. To keep them on track, I try to pretend that I don’t want anyone to clean up. And while I’m sleeping, that’s their cue for them to start cleaning up and putting their toys away.

Student: Go, go, go, go, go. Laura Scatena-Romero: They like it because I’m a character, so they can trick me while playing the game. Are you guys cleaning?

Student: No. We’re playing hide stuff in the bin. I told you. Laura Scatena-Romero: Oh!

Jocelyn Greene: This pattern repeats itself until the room is clean, and they are totally triumphant. They get to be the good guys and be the cleaner-upper heroes. The joy of outsmarting a villain is so real and so victorious that the kids are getting practice being good and cleaning up through play, which is their love language. Laura Scatena-Romero: Good job, butterflies. Round of applause.

Student: Yay.

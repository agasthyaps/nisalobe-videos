Financial literacy has become a big topic in recent years, with many schools taking concrete steps to integrate it into the K–12 curriculum. This is a welcome trend, as research shows that learning about personal finance leads to widespread benefits when students enter the adult world—from less debt and greater savings to higher credit scores. There are many ways to teach personal finance and integrate lessons on topics like budgeting, taxes, and interest rates into coursework, regardless of subject or age level.

Here are five engaging and easy-to-deploy ideas to try out this year to help young people build better money management skills. To learn more about the research cited in the video, check out the links below. Jeremy Burke, J.

## Transcript

Narrator : Personal finance is a vital life skill, so it makes sense that more and more schools are starting to teach it. But when kids learn about complex topics like interest rates, budgets, and taxes, does the information just go in one ear and out the other? Not at all. Several studies confirm that personal finance education in high school leads to less debt, higher credit scores, and greater savings in college and beyond. To help support students’ financial futures, here are five ways to integrate financial literacy into class. In the early grades, it’s useful for students to practice differentiating between what they need and what they want. A distinction that may not come naturally. Try giving elementary students cards that have pictures of items on them like blankets, cell phones, dried food, and candy. Then in small groups have students choose a handful of items that they’d take with them on a deserted island. They learn that some things are essential and others are just desirable. Older students can benefit from more explicit instruction into how to budget their money. To help, try out the bean game. Give students 20 beans and a piece of paper depicting a selection of living expenses across categories like housing, food, clothing, and transportation. Make some options more expensive than others. Within transportation, for example, riding a bus could equal one bean, while buying a new car and gas could equal four beans. Let students work with a partner to decide how to budget their 20 beans. Kids are curious about getting their first credit cards, but they often don’t know much about them. Take advantage of this curiosity and have students create spreadsheets or perform calculations by hand to see how various cards stack up, comparing their interest rates, cashback policies, benefits, and late fees. When the day comes for students to get actual credit cards, they’ll be able to make an informed decision. Teaching students about real-world budgeting in math class can boost engagement while it supports financial literacy. Have students choose a career from a list of options that you provide. Then give them a monthly salary based on the actual figures for that job. For a month, set aside a few minutes each day and have students research and choose between apartments, transportation options, different groceries, and more, calculating which choices they’d be able to afford on their income. It’s not a light lift, but a schoolwide savings program can offer students hands-on experience with saving up their money. Start by giving students envelopes to take home and encourage them to bring in any amount of money, even 25 cents to school each Friday. When students graduate, they get back all the money they’ve saved. You could even partner with a local credit union to create an actual account for each student. Activities like these can help ensure that kids will make smart decisions as they enter the world of adult finances.

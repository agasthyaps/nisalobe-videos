## Article

Most people are familiar with the game Would You Rather . In it, you’re given two options and must choose one, like “Would you rather have pizza or tacos for dinner every night forever?” But beyond a brain break, this simple decision-making game can be transformed into a versatile learning tool—teachers can use the game to encourage reasoning and reflection by bringing new perspectives to class material. Posing quick, fun, critical thinking questions can be useful in all stages of instruction, from gauging students’ background knowledge on a topic while kicking off a new unit to wrapping up a section with a dipstick question assessing what the class has absorbed.

For instance, in math, it can serve as a warm-up activity: When starting a unit on the metric system, asking students if they would rather run 10 meters or 10 yards can help teachers assess their familiarity with these measurements. Before reading a novel in language arts, for example, teachers can gather information on student preferences by asking if students prefer digital or traditional books. During science lessons, the game can introduce experiments or units, posing a binary question like “On the savanna, would you rather be able to camouflage yourself or run fast?” In social studies, teachers can assess understanding of historical events by asking students to choose between two events they could witness—for example, the Boston Tea Party or Paul Revere’s ride—and encourage them to explain their choices.

The game can even help with social and emotional skill building, helping students become more self-aware by posing choices like which of two coping strategies works best for them. In every subject area, the Would You Rather game provides a versatile framework for fostering reasoning, encouraging reflection on content, and exploring complex topics—in a matter of minutes.

## Transcript

Narrator: In the familiar game of Would You Rather, someone is given two options and must choose one. For example, would you rather eat pizza or tacos every day for dinner? But it can be more than a fun and simple game. It also supports higher-order thinking and makes a great tool for the classroom. By relating your questions to academic content, you offer an engaging way to introduce concepts, check in during a lesson, or assess students’ understanding in any subject area. Try using Would You Rather as a warm-up. When beginning a unit on the metric system, asking, “Would you rather run 10 meters or 10 yards?” can help you determine which students have experience with these measurements. And during class, you can pose a question, “Would you rather use multiplication or repeated addition to solve this problem?” You can always ask why to create opportunities for deeper thinking. Before reading a novel, use the game to gather information on student preferences: “Would you rather read a digital book or a traditional physical one?” Or you could gauge background knowledge. Prior to reading Charlotte’s Web , you could ask, “Would you rather care for a pig or a spider? Why?” Throughout reading instruction, you can use Would You Rather to help students compare characters and their motivations or other story elements. Before diving into a science experiment or unit, you might ask, “In the savanna, would you rather be able to camouflage yourself or run 15 miles per hour?” During research, students can answer questions to demonstrate what information they’ve learned. “Would you rather live in an area prone to hurricanes or tornadoes? Create bullet points and be ready to discuss.” In social studies, you can assess what students have absorbed. “Would you rather witness the Boston Tea Party or Paul Revere’s ride? Explain your choice.” Ask your students to give at least one reason why they didn’t choose the other option. This helps students relate to historic moments in new ways while expressing their understanding of concepts. Questions can even help students choose coping strategies or become more self-aware. “When feeling stressed, would you rather listen to music or take a walk?” “Would you rather take a written test or give a speech in front of a class?” The possibilities are endless. The engaging framework created by Would You Rather can help students approach complex topics in a simple way, while opening the door for reasoning and reflecting on a deeper level.

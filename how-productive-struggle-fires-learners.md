## Transcript

Narrator: Students often believe that low-effort studying strategies are the most effective, favoring passive learning approaches like memorization, rereading, highlighting text, and listening to lectures. But those tactics can leave students with the false impression that they’ve mastered the material when they almost certainly haven’t. Meanwhile, struggle in the classroom is viewed as a sign that things are going badly. Teachers and students may opt for smooth sailing instead. But the truth is that easy and learning don’t usually go hand-in-hand. It’s when students are pushed beyond their comfort zone to solve problems that are hard but still within their ability that they engage in productive struggle and dramatically improve their learning outcomes. In a 2019 study, for example, researchers discovered that students preferred lectures to challenging activities like hands-on experiments and group problem-solving. Unfortunately, the lecture students scored 10 points lower than their counterparts on the follow-up test. And in a landmark 2008 study, seventh-grade students who regularly practiced solving complex open-ended problems became sophisticated thinkers, outscoring their peers from a more traditional lecture-based classroom by 57 percent when answering challenging test questions. Temporary confusion and frustration aren’t necessarily things to be avoided, the researchers concluded. Instead, they’re the precursors to deeper, more durable learning. What makes productive struggle so effective? When students struggle to apply learning in new and challenging ways, they are more likely to probe for novel or unexpected connections, consider multiple ways to solve problems, and wrestle with the underlying differences between correct and incorrect solutions—all hallmarks of long-term retention. They also develop resilience, complex reasoning skills, and learn how to set and achieve goals while developing a healthy attitude toward making mistakes. So think about how to push your students toward productive struggle, and try to be patient if they express frustration. Explain that temporary confusion isn’t a sign of weakness or incompetence. It’s how brains are supposed to feel when they are on fire with activity.

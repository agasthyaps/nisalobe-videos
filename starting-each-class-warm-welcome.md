## Transcript

Narrator: The start of a new school year is often filled with emotions and uncertainty, now more than ever. As you plan for the return to school, consider establishing a new practice that helps students feel warmly welcomed as they come back. We know students learn best when they feel safe and connected, and you’ll be setting norms that will lay a strong foundation for classroom management right from the beginning. Rather than jumping into instruction, opening each class with an activity, routine, or ritual that connects students to each other in a meaningful way can build classroom community all year long. Daily wellness checks serve a dual purpose that helps strengthen and build students’ self-awareness skills while giving you a quick pulse check on how each student in your class is doing. Tools such as zones of regulation, or the mood meter, give students a shared emotional vocabulary to express how they’re feeling. You can ask students to volunteer individual updates or offer a central place where students can post their status to quickly understand where everyone is at that day. After months of being apart, students need to connect and build relationships. Go-around questions are a simple way to learn something about each other, share feelings, or just have fun as a group. Try an activity like rose and thorn, where each student offers one thing making them happy and one challenge. Or ask a question on a theme, like “What are you looking forward to this weekend?” You can also try circle games, which are a kinetic way to help build trust, like snowball toss or name and motion. In a snowball toss, students respond to a prompt, like “What’s your biggest hope for this year?” Write it down on a piece of paper, crumble it, and toss it to the center. At the end, students pick up the snowballs and read them aloud, giving the class a feeling of solidarity and support. Grounding exercises offer a way to help center and uplift students at the start of class. Take a moment for three collective breaths. Focus on a calm-down glitter jar, or do a series of stretches to awaken students and let out any distracting energy. You can also try a five-minute meditation. Use a recording from an app, or lead students along with a visualization of your own. These exercises set a calm tone and let students know that school is a welcoming, peaceful place where they can learn and be supported. Even if you do not have time for a daily circle, smiling warmly and greeting each person by their preferred name as they enter your classroom makes students feel seen and builds a safe, inclusive classroom environment.

> By turning a plain old hallway into a destination that every class visits regularly to tinker and play, a school made limited resources go further and saw student enthusiasm soar.

## Article

At Dyce Primary School in Aberdeen, Scotland, an ordinary corridor that was once used only to get from one place to another has become a treasure trove of resources where students construct, create, and explore new ideas. Each class has scheduled time in the makerspace-like “Construction Corridor” every week, where imaginations have a chance to run wild. Teachers observe the students at play during choice time there to note what’s drawing their attention and then tailor classroom instruction to tap into that interest.

With the themes and activities in the corridor changing regularly, every visit makes the most of students’ natural desire for novelty—and the time there feels more special.

## Transcript

Sarah Law: OK.

Boy: Ready, set, go.

Boy: That went a long ways!

Sarah Law: Whoa.

Jenny Watson: There’re things that they create and design in the corridor that we haven’t even thought of. They can choose where they want to spend their time. I think that’s where they get their motivation and where you get the engagement. Particularly if you’ve got some really reluctant learners. If you see them really engaged in something, you can take that back into the classroom and hook them in that way.

Megan Ward: The Construction Corridor is an area of the school which we use to get from place to place, but it’s also utilized as an area where we can set up playful experiences.

Jenny Watson: Each month the corridor changes, so it’s different provocations that are out there. So, right now our big expedition question is, “What gives us power?” So, it’s a Power Station. [Laughs] The last expedition was, “What makes each of us unique?” So, it was a Celebration Corridor. So, it just changes with the expeditions.

Megan Ward: Each class in the school gets a slot in the week. The children get to choose what they interact with.

Jenny Watson: So, there’s lots of construction, there’s some digital robotic Bee-Bots. There’s blank canvas for drawing. The children are invited to explore power in a variety of different ways.

Sarah Law: And this area has been changed into a Power Station. OK?

Sarah Law: So, around the same idea that they’re focusing on in class. So, they can deepen their learning there.

Jenny Watson: We don’t have a big budget. In the corridor, because the whole school uses it, we can gather all the resources from across the school, so that everyone can share them.

Megan Ward: We are going to spend some time looking at these activities. You can explore and find something that you would like to play with.

Caledonia: It changes every couple weeks. You can do, like, what you would like.

Kuwam: You can build some ramps and play with helicopters.

Megan Ward: I can observe different groups of children playing. I can see what they’re enjoying.

Megan Ward: Kuwam, do you know what you’re up to?

Megan Ward: And the information that I gather is so valuable because it helps me with my planning. It helps me to see what their gaps in their knowledge are.

Student: We’ve been needing a hover board.

Megan Ward: A hover board? Is that because it’s got two wheels?

Megan Ward: Oh, I see.

Sarah Law: You can get to know the children and you can get to know their interests and get to know them on a deeper level.

Sarah Law: Some trees. That would be a good idea.

Sarah Law: And it means that you can then plan to follow what they want to do.

Sarah Law: So, we’ve got wind powering your city.

Megan Ward: If you provide something hands-on or playful, they get to develop all these key skills of communication, confidence, resilience. They’re much more likely to enjoy it. To remember what they’re learning. To be able to share and talk about it, which is also really important.

## Transcript

Child Narrator: Hissing Breath, start of the day. Sit up tall. Inhale deeply for three to five counts. Exhale slowly and steadily, making an “S” or hissing sound. At the bottom of your exhale, close your mouth. Inhale again through your nose and repeat for several rounds.

Child Narrator: Helicopter Arms, right before the first break. Sit up tall in your chair, feet on the floor. Inhale, reaching your arms out to your side like a “T.” Exhale, turning your arms and middle to the right. Inhale, sitting up tall in your body. Exhale, turning your gaze over your shoulder, and breathe. Inhale, coming back to center. Exhale as you repeat on the left.

Child Narrator: Wind Breath, after a break. Sit up tall. Inhale through the nose. Exhale through your mouth, as if you’re whistling with no sound. Inhale again through your nose; repeat for several rounds.

Child Narrator: Echo Yoga, during a midafternoon energy dip. Ask for a volunteer student leader. The leader moves through a couple of yoga poses without talking. With each pose, the leader changes facial expressions. Follow the leader’s movement and expression choices. Repeat with a new leader.

Child Narrator: Rainbow Spine, end of the day. Sit up tall in your chair, feet on the floor, hands on knees. Inhale and rock forward, pressing your knees against your hands and arching your back. Exhale and rock backward, pressing your hands into your knees and rounding your back. Repeat for several rounds.

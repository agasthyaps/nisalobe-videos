# Encouraging Students to Own Their Academic Growth

> When students use a hands-on approach to track their own progress against goals, they begin to take responsibility for their learning.

## Article

At Barbara Morgan STEM Academy , a K–5 school in Meridian, Idaho, one of their hallmark approaches to developing independent learners is to ask students to track their progress and monitor their academic growth from a very young age. In Kim Miller’s second-grade class, students spend time on a weekly basis adding data to their learning binders—simple three-ring folios organized into sections. In them, students use colored pencils to record test scores, graph their progress, set goals, and revisit those goals regularly.

The class also tunes in to habits of mind, like stamina, and celebrates their accomplishments together. By normalizing transparency and focusing on growth, Miller creates a classroom culture where students feel excited about keeping tabs on their effort and outcomes. “When they can track their own progress, they have more ownership in it,” says Miller.

“They’re not just taking a random test to get a score for somebody else. It now belongs to them instead of all the grownups in their world.” The work that Miller’s young students are doing in the learning binders develops important habits and executive function skills—and helps them cultivate a growth mindset as they progress through the grade levels. “We do some wonderful goal setting and data collection at the K–1 level here, so that by the time they are in fourth and fifth grade, their goal setting is very complex and rigorous,” says Miller.

According to Barbara Morgan STEM Academy’s principal, Katie Mittleider, “It’s exciting to see kids talking about their growth, talking about where they’re trying to get, and really understanding what that means and why they’re learning it.” For more ideas about how to support students as they track their progress and learning goals, read Amanda Adams’s article for Edutopia, “ How to Use Microtracking to Promote Student Autonomy .”

## Transcript

Kim Miller : I’m going to call you a table at a time to go get your binders. Because we have learning binders, my students have more ownership of their own learning. There’s a lot of research that kids, when they can track their own progress, that they have more ownership in it. They’re not just taking a random test to get a score for somebody else. It now belongs to them, instead of all the grownups in their world. Katie Mittleider : Here at Barbara Morgan STEM Academy, we are a K–5 school, and we have a very stable population here. That allows us to really dig deep with our students. Kim Miller : Let’s have a conversation about where you should be and where you are. Katie Mittleider : We get them excited about where they’re at, where they want to go, setting those goals, and then the process that it takes to get there. Kim Miller : All right, flip your page to the next page. And you are on your reading fluency. I think everyone give yourselves a big pat on the back. When we go through our learning binders, the kids track all kinds of things in there. Every week they graph their spelling tests. Anytime we take the state reading test, they’re graphing those scores in there. Presley : A learning binder is what we already learned and what we’re going to learn. It’s kind of like graphing stuff and goals. Kim Miller : We also graph things like their stamina. What does stamina mean? Student : It means how long you can focus. Kim Miller : Good job. Presley : It’s how much minutes you could focus without talking to a friend or messing around. Kim Miller : So, here’s your new stamina scores to graph. Our goal by the end of the year is to be at 30 minutes. There you go. Student : Yes. [inaudible 00:01:55]. Kim Miller : I swear. Good improvement this month. Student : I got 20. Kim Miller : The second section of the data binder is all about goal setting. So we sit down in the fall and we review what goals do you want to set, and then we revisit again in the winter and again in the spring. It’s time to start looking at our data and setting some goals for the wintertime. Who can tell me what is your goal each week in word study? Katie Mittleider : It’s exciting to see kids talking about their growth. Student : You are trying to get past the gray spots. Katie Mittleider : Talking about where they’re trying to get and really understanding what that means and why they’re learning it. Kim Miller : It’s great that we do goal setting and data collecting at the K–1 level here, so that by the time they are in fourth and fifth grade, their goal setting is very complex and it’s very rigorous. Wow. There’s been some great growth. Student : Yes.

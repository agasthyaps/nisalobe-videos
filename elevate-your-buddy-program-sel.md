## Transcript

Narrator : Cross-age buddy programs are a longtime staple in many elementary schools, much loved for promoting a positive school culture. But they’re not just about cute connections and fun. Research shows when a buddy system is in place, students benefit from an environment that is more inclusive and more supportive of schoolwork and social and behavioral needs. How can you take your buddy program to the next level, so both the little ones and the big ones are making gains in both social skills and academics? Narrator : One of the strongest benefits of a buddy system is that students have another person in the school building who knows them well. But sometimes, the first few meetings can be awkward. Early on in your program, help your students get to know each other. Provide questions they can use as a starting point for discussion on topics like favorite foods or hobbies. Students will have a chance to bond, noting things they have in common and embracing their differences. By giving students a starting point, you’ll be supporting conversation and connection, and helping to develop social skills for both students. Narrator : Additional time for literacy benefits every student, and buddy time can be an excellent opportunity to build a culture of readers. Consider starting each session with one-on-one read-alouds. It’s a chance for older students to practice their fluency skills, and for younger students to revel in individualized attention. Before the meet-up, hold a mini-training session for the big kids. In addition to helping them select books that will be comfortable for them to read out loud and interesting to their younger buddy, ask them to find places in the book to pause and ask questions, like what do you think is going to happen next? Or what would you do if you were in this character’s shoes? This gives older students a chance to sharpen executive functioning skills and be better prepared to develop critical thinking skills for their little pals. Narrator : Teaching a topic is an excellent way to solidify it for yourself. Giving older students a chance to share their knowledge with younger ones can build skills for both age groups. Ask the big kids to lead an activity where little ones can practice skills they’re currently working on, or deepen their understanding of content. In the process, the leaders will further their own mastery. The older students will need to prepare, so allow time beforehand for them to work together, to think about how they want to present their lesson. Chances are good the younger students will delight in the lesson led by the kids they look up to, and the older students will develop confidence and a sense of pride.

## Article

Classic tabletop games like Uno, Jenga, and Connect Four might look like simple fun, but at Gilles-Sweet Elementary School in Fairview Park, Ohio, kindergarten teacher Keri Laughlin uses them as powerful learning tools that help students practice valuable social skills like communication, collaboration, and problem-solving—all while playing. Laughlin creates stations around the room with a variety of popular and familiar board, card, and tabletop games. Before play begins, Laughlin gathers her class in a circle to explain the rules and answer questions.

Students then have the opportunity to choose which game they want to play. As they play, Laughlin moves from group to group, observing how students interact—listening to conversations, noticing who takes turns, and seeing how they navigate challenges together. “When they’re playing, they’re using their imagination,” Laughlin says.

“They’re using skills they’re going to need for the rest of their life to be successful.” After a set amount of time, students have the opportunity to rotate to a new game. Laughlin intentionally selects games that help her students develop a number of skills at once—not just academically, but socially and emotionally as well. She watches how they handle tricky moments, from disagreements over rules to frustration after a loss, and celebrates when students support one another.

“Today, not one student asked me to solve a problem for them,” she notes. “They actually worked together and were able to solve problems on their own.” Through these moments during choice game time, Laughlin gains insight into her students’ developing social skills: how they communicate, regulate emotions, take turns, and show empathy. The same skills—listening, cooperating, and self-regulating—carry over to academic tasks and everyday interactions.

In Laughlin’s classroom, what looks like play is actually a carefully guided learning experience. Classic games give kindergarten students a safe space to build confidence and independence, and practice working in teams. Through laughter, strategy, and collaboration, students learn to connect, cooperate, and thrive—both in school and beyond.

## Transcript

Keri Laughlin: So now, friends, look at Noah. What color do you have to have now?

Noah: Yellow.

Keri Laughlin: Yellow. Because we use games to develop multiple skills at once, our students are able to problem-solve, communicate, and interact through play. When they are playing, they’re using their imagination. They’re using skills that they’re going to need for the rest of their life to be successful. All right. If you don’t know these games, I want to explain them. If someone in your group has already played them, then they are a great tool for you to use. Today, we started in a circle. I explain each game with the students, make sure that they don’t have any questions.

Student: You did a good job. Nice try.

Keri Laughlin: When I’m choosing the games, I look at something that gives me an opportunity to see them grow as an individual and be able to work together through something different than just an academic activity. Let’s see. Hattie, what choice would you like to make?

Hattie: Uno.

Keri Laughlin: Uno. Go ahead, girly. I give them choice of where they would like to go, and then that’s when I start to walk around the classroom to observe what they’re doing and how they are interacting with each other.

Student: [inaudible 00:01:11] really yummy.

Student: Ooh, now you can pick anything. You could swap [inaudible 00:01:14].

Keri Laughlin: Are they able to actually play a game? Are they able to take turns? Are they able to listen to each other? Are they able to have a conversation?

Student: Does it have a bun?

Student: No.

Keri Laughlin: If someone doesn’t win, are they able to understand that? If someone doesn’t understand the game, will they communicate with each other? But I’m also looking for just in the social aspect of can you be a team player.

Student: You stacked it up. You got to do this, Nico.

Keri Laughlin: Today, not one student asked me to solve a problem for them. They actually were working together and were able to solve the problems on their own.

Student: Is it an apple?

Student: No.

Student: Is it ice cream?

Student: Yes.

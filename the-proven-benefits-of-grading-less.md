## Article

When assignments are handed back to students, it’s natural for them to focus on the grade rather than the feedback. It’s even been shown that when students see their grade first, they’re more likely to ignore the accompanying notes and reflections from the teacher entirely. But a letter grade doesn’t tell the whole story.

In fact, research shows that there are many benefits to grading less frequently—leading to more impactful feedback and deeper learning in the long run. Indeed, A through F grades are helpful for providing the macro view of a student’s achievement, but they can actually be a barrier to academic improvement and innovative teaching. They tend to heighten anxiety and push students away from challenging courses rather than provide them with low-stakes opportunities to try, fail, and try again.

Not only that, but grading is time-consuming. It occupies an outsized proportion of teachers’ time and incentivizes them to reduce assignments overall. To find more reasons why grading less can have benefits for both teachers and students—and for a list of ideas on what to do instead—read Stephen Merrill and Youki Terada’s article for Edutopia, “ Why Teachers Should Grade Less Frequently .” To learn more about the research cited in the video, check out the resources below.

## Transcript

Narrator: It’s a common problem. Students get an assignment back and immediately check the grade, ignoring the teacher’s suggestions for improvement. But when educators separate feedback from grades, learning takes off. A 2021 study found that students who saw the grades after they saw their feedback did better on subsequent assignments by two-thirds of a letter grade. A through F and other summative grading systems do have value. They provide students and their families with a bird’s-eye view of academic achievement. But there are good reasons to rethink the frequency and timing of traditional grading regimens. The average teacher spends five hours each week grading papers and assignments. The time and energy spent grading is often a barrier to innovative teaching, according to 2017 research. That’s time that could be better spent improving lessons, reflecting on student feedback, developing hands-on learning activities, or preparing thoughtful discussion questions. While they can feel like objective benchmarks, grades often fail to provide reliable information about student learning. Research shows that educators unwittingly give higher grades to essays with good handwriting, associate being overweight with laziness and low academic potential, and tend to score students of color more harshly. Essays and other written materials are notoriously difficult to grade objectively, and seemingly standardized options like multiple-choice tests have the potential to incorporate bias or give misleading information about what students actually know. The compulsion to grade everything can push teachers to reduce assignments, limiting a student’s chances to practice and improve. Without enough opportunities to try, fail, and try again in a low-stakes environment, students are far less likely to grow and improve, especially on complex tasks like writing or solving hard math or physics problems. Grades might motivate high performers. But for average and struggling students, summative grades don’t seem to light a fire. According to motivation researcher Chris Holloman, the push for high marks doesn’t always result in better performance or deeper learning, and students aren’t necessarily driven to do their best work by grades alone. In fact, a 2018 study found that traditional A through F grades not only increased anxiety, but also made students more likely to avoid challenging courses. Some districts require proof of regular grading. But when you can, consider holding your letter grades until students have processed your feedback. Or try mixing in frequent ungraded assignments that include only verbal or written reflections. You can also give more practice quizzes, ask students to assess each other’s work, or use low-stakes formative assessment tools instead of high-stakes alternatives to keep the focus on progress and learning, not the grades.

## Article

When librarians Becca Isaac and Rebecca Webster set out to turn their library at Fauquier High School in Warrenton, Virginia, into a more inviting place, they started with the doors—they’re wide open. In between classes, you’ll often find one of the librarians standing outside, ready to greet students as they come in. Once inside, students can easily find a space within the library that suits their needs.

Comfy chairs and sofas give students a chance to relax, while collaborative tables provide space for them to work together on projects. The maker zone offers supplies like markers and paper. Everywhere, there is student artwork, book displays, and chances for students to interact.

Open mic poetry, book clubs, and collaborative craft projects give students a chance to see themselves in the library and contribute to a warm environment. And notably, before school and during lunch, there’s audible chatter and laughter as students socialize and play games—a noise level that the librarians welcome, especially as the teens continue to relearn social skills they lost during the pandemic. Says Webster, “After Covid especially, students forgot how to talk to each other.

So I love when we see a group with their phones down and they’re all talking or playing a game.” To find more ideas for taking your school library to the next level, read Paige Tutt’s article for Edutopia titled “ Setting Up Libraries to Be the Best Space in School .”

## Transcript

Student: Can I get a lollipop if I use the word of the day, Ms. Webster?

Rebecca Webster: Of course.

Student: The lesson was very insipid. It was very boring.

Rebecca Webster: OK. There you go. Good job. Building relationships, I think, is really important. If they know that you care about them, they’re more likely to come into the library. That small little touch of knowing their name or remembering that they had a game last night is really big. And then once they’re here, then they start to trust you to give them the book recommendations and to guide them to the research that they need.

Rebecca Webster: There you go.

Students: Thank you.

Rebecca Webster: My mission has been getting them in the door. And even if they never pick up a book, they’re surrounded by books while they’re here and letting them know that they have a safe space.

Becca Isaac: We always try to welcome them when they come in and learn their names.

Teacher: Thank you, Nathan.

Rebecca Webster:Those little things when they first walk in, they make a big difference. There’s the would-you-rather question.

Becca Isaac: Sometimes kids will just pop their head in. Oh, what’s the would-you-rather today? And they’ll just do it real quick and then move on.

Rebecca Webster: We have students that are having a bad day. They’ll come here first in the morning.

Campbell: There’s so many reasons. I usually come to meet up with friends or do extra work that I don’t have time to do at home.

Samyra: I didn’t used to like being in the library, but when I met the librarians, they were so welcoming, so I decided to come more. I just really like their environment. They make me feel comfortable.

Teacher: Kaylyn, that looks amazing.

Kaylyn: Thanks.

Teacher: Yours looks good too, Gavin.

Becca Isaac: We’ve changed it from what is like a traditional library to more of a learning commons model, which means that there’s different zones in the library. So you have a classroom space. You have like a quiet space where people can read with comfortable chairs. You have a zone where they can collaborate on projects. So we have team tables where they can hook up their Chromebook and everybody can collaborate that way. And we have the maker zone where they can use the supplies. We have a craft every week. We try to find things that aren’t too difficult but that are kind of like stress relievers. There’s so many ways that students are using the library. Some people are working on a puzzle. Some people are doing a coloring page. Some people are studying. Some are just chatting with their friends for a little bit. At lunchtime, we have students that come in and maybe they don’t want to go to the cafeteria because it’s too overwhelming for them.

Rebecca Webster: After Covid especially, students forgot how to talk to each other. So I love when we see a group with their phones down and they’re all talking or playing a game.

Student: Who’s doing the stars?

Student: Me, I’m going. You know, I still won.

Campbell: Libraries are usually really quiet, but we laugh a lot. It’s just like such a great environment.

Becca Isaac: Before, it might have been more like the shushing zone. There is a noise level there, but it’s fine. They’re having fun, they’re enjoying each other’s friendship. I think the library’s a good place for them to come and do that. I’ve seen a lot of changes over the years, and I feel really good about where the library is now with all the different events that we do and getting them in the door. So now it is more of a welcoming space.

Campbell: People that go here, there’s regulars per se, and we really love it here.

Rebecca Webster: The library, it should be the hub of the school. There are so many things that they come to us for. You don’t just come for books.

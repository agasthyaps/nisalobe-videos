While the value of play for pre-K and early elementary is well documented , it tends to trail off completely by the time students reach middle and high school. Playful activities are limited to serving as a reward or a break in the academics. But joyful, social, engaging activities offer just as much benefit to older students as they do for little ones, especially when they are connected to core content.

In fact, bringing in elements of playful learning for teens into classrooms can help them learn more deeply—and make content more memorable. As teachers design their lessons, they can consider a few elements that bring more play into the curriculum while improving learning. For example, leaning in to teenagers’ developmental need for socializing can help them learn material more effectively.

When lessons are structured in a way that gives students a chance to work together and share their ideas with each other, whether in pairs or in a small group, they are more likely to remember them. It’s crucial to remember that rigor and joy are not mutually exclusive—combining the two in creative hands-on projects can help students explore content in a way that is more engaging to them, especially if they find the work to be meaningful. Providing the “why” behind the learning is particularly impactful for teenagers, so that they feel a greater sense of relevance and purpose.

And if teachers can work in an authentic audience to whom students will ultimately present, all the better. Iteration—or tinkering—is another element of play that can be enormously effective in the classroom. Giving students a chance to explore, test, and try again helps build resilience and confidence.

And teachers should not give them all the answers. Figuring things out on their own is fun! Finally, getting students out of their seats and on their feet is highly beneficial, so alternate activities that require quiet focus with opportunities to move—maybe even bringing class outside.

Fresh air and a change of scenery is invigorating, and getting students up and moving activates their brains and improves their attention. Most important, teachers should play along! That participation models a willingness to take a risk, demonstrate vulnerability, and have some fun—something students will remember for a long time to come.

## Transcript

Narrator: It’s well established that children learn through play, and pre-K and early elementary classrooms are often set up for it. But as students get older, play largely falls by the wayside. It’s limited to serving as a reward for students or a break in the academics. But plenty of learning happens through meaningful play at all ages. By leaning into teenagers’ developmental need for socializing, you can help them learn material more effectively. Structure part of your lesson so that students must articulate their ideas to each other. Ask them to work in pairs or small groups. When students have to explain their thinking out loud to their peers, they grasp the concept more deeply. Providing students with projects they find fun doesn’t mean letting go of academic rigor. A physics lesson that concludes with a car race allows students to explore a hands-on understanding of force and drag. When developing a lesson, start with standards and objectives, and then layer in creative pursuits that students will find exciting. Blending rigor and joy often gets students to engage more deeply, so the learning will stick. Providing the why behind content is an important step to getting students on board with learning it. Connect content to an end use or purpose, so that students don’t feel like they’re wasting their time. And when possible, be sure the work you’re asking them to do has an authentic audience, so they feel compelled to rise to the challenge. Real-world relevance helps students dig wholeheartedly into the task at hand. Giving students a chance to explore, try, test, and try again helps build resilience and confidence. Build in class time for students to assess their work, reflect on what they might do differently, and make changes. Most importantly, don’t give them all the answers. Figuring things out is the fun part, and it gives students a chance to make meaning on their own terms. Keeping still for too long isn’t beneficial to our bodies or our brains, and trudging between classes isn’t enough movement to spark inspiration for young people. Alternate activities that require quiet focus with opportunities to move. Make sure part of your lesson requires students to get out of their seats, and if it’s feasible, bring class outside. Fresh air and a change of scenery is invigorating, and getting students up and moving activates their brains and improves their attention. One of the most important keys to playful learning, you have to play along. Participating models a willingness to take a risk, demonstrate vulnerability, and have some fun, something your students will remember for a long time to come.

## Transcript

Narrator: It’s normal for students to experience conflict, inside and outside of the classroom. Teaching them how to navigate and resolve their problems is an important part of their social-emotional growth. But how can we assist students in building their conflict resolution skills without simply solving all of their problems for them? Help students think proportionally about how to respond to problems, from losing their homework to a sick family member, by using a big problem versus little problem worksheet. Students can assess the severity of each example on a 1 to 5 scale and learn how to calibrate their reactions. The playground can be a common source of conflict. Set up peace paths with a short set of conversational prompts that two or more children can use to work through interpersonal problems. While progressing through a sequence of steps, students discuss their feelings, brainstorm solutions, and find a way to move forward. Show students that a fresh perspective can be a huge help when solving a problem. Pair students together, then have everyone write down a problem they are facing on a sticky note. Each student will spend a minute speaking about their respective issue. Then the duo can collectively brainstorm different solutions to address it. When conflict arises, encourage students to employ a bit of scripted empathy. Ask a question like “If you were me, the teacher, how would you handle this?” Prompting students to articulate an issue from another perspective can help them to take a step back from their own behavior, assess the situation with fresh eyes, and determine the most effective way to proceed. Aid students in making healthy choices by filling out a decision matrix. Students can evaluate the impact of their decisions by using a simple point system. For each example, students allot a point for a positive consequence of their decision and deduct a point for any negative consequences they can identify.

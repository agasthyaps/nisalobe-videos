Self-regulation is a vital skill for students to develop in elementary school—and throughout their education. It helps them manage their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, reducing classroom disruptions and supporting growth. The good news is there are many proven strategies to support both students and teachers in effectively navigating difficult emotions during the school day.

Regular check-ins create a space for students to share their thoughts, feelings, and concerns, fostering caring relationships between teachers and students and promoting classroom safety. Activities like sticky note check-ins, programs like Zones of Regulation , or quick ways to take the temperature like roses and thorns can help maintain consistent connections. Teaching students about their emotions empowers them to understand how their feelings influence behavior and cognitive functions like attention span, memory, and executive functioning.

Tools like mood meters, emotional wheels, and feeling charts can help students build an emotional vocabulary, making it easier to express their needs, especially during stressful moments. Storytelling can also aid in recognizing and naming emotions. During read alouds in class, students can identify the emotions and feelings of the characters.

In stressful situations, it’s crucial for students to have the skill set to respond appropriately. Teaching perspective helps them gauge the magnitude of problems. Activities like “ Size of the Problem ,” which helps students evaluate challenges on a 1 to 5 scale, allow them to understand the difference between minor issues (like a broken pencil) and serious problems (like having a family member in the hospital).

Creating a designated space for students to pause and reset can aid emotional regulation. A peace corner, with calming items like bean bags, stuffed animals, and sensory toys, offers students a chance to collect themselves. Activities like mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques can further support emotional regulation.

Ultimately, self-regulation is a lifelong skill that can be taught in elementary school and beyond, to help create supportive, flexible, and effective classroom environments for both students and teachers. For more resources, read Daniel Leonard’s “ 19 Ways to Help Elementary Students Self-Regulate .” Special education teacher Nina Parrish’s article “ How to Teach Self-Regulation ” is a great introduction. Literacy equity coach Kathy Collier’s article “ Self-Regulation Practices for Teachers and Students ” and principal Jasmine Brann’s “ Guiding Students to Manage Their Emotions ” share great strategies for teachers as well.

## Transcript

Narrator: Self-regulation is an essential skill for students to learn and practice at every stage of their development. Here are some teacher-tested tools that can help developing young minds and bodies flourish every day, and help prevent disruptions in the classroom. Many students do well with consistent routines, clear expectations, and time to positively connect with teachers. Schedule regular check-ins with your students to help you build caring relationships and a space for them to share their thoughts, feelings, and concerns. This supports a sense of safety in the classroom. To maintain consistent connection with students, try doing an activity like roses and thorns, sticky note check-ins, or Zones of Regulation every day. Teaching students about how their brain functions can empower them to understand how their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors impact their attention span, memory, and executive functioning. Help them build their emotional vocabulary by using mood meters, emotional wheels, or feeling charts to practice talking about their emotions. This gives them ways to express themselves and establish their needs during periods of stress. Stories can also help your students recognize and name emotions. Try asking students to identify what a certain character might be feeling in your next read aloud. When students are challenged with stressful situations, they need tools to practice responding appropriately. Developing perspective is important for students to regulate their reactions. Teach a lesson like Size of the Problem, which includes a worksheet that introduces students to understanding the magnitude of problems on a scale from 1 to 5. For example, breaking a pencil will warrant a different response than having a close family member in the hospital. Use examples relevant to students’ lives to help them make sense of their realities. Having designated spaces for students to take a pause when they are wrestling with difficult feelings and need time to collect themselves can support them to independently reset during the school day. Design a peace corner with a timer and objects like beanbag chairs, stuffed animals, and sensory toys. Include illustrative instructions for stretching, breathing, and balancing exercises. Provide guidance for mindfulness meditations like picturing one’s peaceful place or finger tracing breathing exercises to help students who are experiencing intense emotions. Understanding self-regulation as a teachable lifelong skill that every student can hone will help both students and teachers create supportive, flexible, and effective classroom cultures for everyone.

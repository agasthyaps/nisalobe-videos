Lectures are essential teaching tools—but with over half of students losing focus as lectures progress, maintaining student attention can be a challenge. To combat this, educators can use evidence-based techniques to break up lectures and reduce cognitive overload. Research shows that incorporating brief, engaging activities during instruction not only helps sustain attention but also improves comprehension and retention of material.

By incorporating pauses for collaborative interaction, moments of physical activity, and opportunities for active engagement, educators can create a more dynamic learning environment. These methods enhance recall, foster deeper understanding, and encourage participation while helping students stay connected and focused. Thoughtfully breaking up lectures with these techniques ensures that students remain actively involved, making even the longest sessions more productive, impactful, and enjoyable for everyone in the classroom.

## Transcript

Narrator: Every teacher has seen their students lose focus one by one over the course of a lecture. In fact, as lectures carry on, more than half of students’ minds begin to wander. But lectures are essential teaching tools. So, how do you keep your classroom focused while you communicate the curriculum? Breaking up your instructional delivery with these research-based activities will keep your students from maxing out their cognitive load and promote better learning. Note-taking is due for an update. Students’ notes are often of spotty quality and capture only 46% of the ideas they’re hearing. Try building in collaborative note-taking breaks. Give students short pauses to be able to catch up and review their notes. It can lead to a six-point increase in factual recall and a 17-point boost in higher-level associative learning. Even better, students who are paired with a partner take more original notes than when they revise alone. A brain break can be as simple as a jumping jack. Elementary and older students alike benefit from short exercise breaks, leading to more focused on-task activity. Try implementing brief movement breaks throughout your lecture. Even just having students walk around the room or stretch their limbs can do the trick. Along with increased concentration, building in movement breaks helps older students to feel more connected, and as a result of that, less worried about speaking up and making mistakes. While they might have a reputation as being scary, a brief low-stakes pop quiz that punctuates your lecture can more deeply encode learning of the material. Try implementing a pause to test your students on what’s been taught thus far in your lecture. Researchers found that students who took frequent pop quizzes scored 13 percent higher, nearly a full letter grade. And don’t worry about the format. All sorts are effective. Multiple choice, queued recall, clickers, fill in the blank, and short answers all work. A good way to ensure your students are absorbing challenging material is to take a break for peer-to-peer teaching. Research has found that this bolsters student engagement and yields a consistent improvement in accuracy. Ask each student to find a partner and teach each other what they’ve learned. Use a tried-and-true activity like turn-and-talk or think-pair-share. By reviewing the concepts as partners, students develop a common understanding of the material, helping to identify their gaps in comprehension so they can fill those gaps together. Finding productive ways to break up your lecture affords your students the space and time to manage their cognitive load, ensuring that they’re able to stay focused on your lecture no matter its length.

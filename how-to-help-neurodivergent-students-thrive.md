Every classroom includes a wide range of student abilities, and finding ways to reach each learner can be daunting. But small tweaks can help smooth the path. Accommodations like staying connected with support networks and families, making the classroom more sensory-friendly, and routinely chunking large tasks into smaller ones help neurodivergent students thrive—and everyone else in the class, too.

Neurodivergent students, including those with autism, ADHD, and other learning differences, bring unique strengths to the classroom. With a little intentional effort, teachers can tap into these strengths to create a more inclusive and effective learning environment. The key lies in a strengths-based approach, which focuses on nurturing what neurodivergent students excel at, boosting their confidence, and helping them feel valued.

One of the most powerful ways to support these learners is by offering authentic praise. Rather than waiting until a final product is complete, teachers can provide feedback throughout the learning process. This helps build a positive internal dialogue and encourages students to focus on their progress, not just their mistakes.

By recognizing effort and growth, teachers empower students to view challenges as opportunities for development. Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps is another simple but effective strategy. Many neurodivergent students struggle with executive functioning skills like organization and time management.

Offering clear checklists, rubrics, and visual models provides the structure they need to succeed without feeling overwhelmed. Creating a sensory-friendly classroom is an often-overlooked but crucial step. Neurodivergent students, particularly those with sensory sensitivities, benefit from environments that minimize distractions.

Reducing clutter, using natural light, and offering quiet spaces can create an atmosphere where every student feels comfortable and ready to learn. Finally, engaging with a student’s support network helps to expand their progress beyond the classroom. Keeping in touch with a neurodivergent student’s parents, therapists, friends, and counselors ensures that the lines of communication remain open and that the entire support team is able to adapt and react to any changes together.

By making these small adjustments, teachers can help neurodivergent students thrive, fostering an environment where all learners have the opportunity to shine.

## Transcript

Narrator: Neurodivergent students have unique strengths and we have a great opportunity to boost their confidence and nurture those strengths. It’s important for teachers to praise neurodivergent students in authentic ways as often as possible because it helps encourage kind internal dialogue for these students. I also think it’s important because it helps students focus on their own strengths and can make a longer-term positive impact on their performance in school. We need to praise them in the process of creating something, not just when you see the final product. It’s really important that teachers and a student’s entire support team do everything they can to help them with executive functioning skills like time management and how to focus, how to set up a workspace, how to organize themselves. The idea here is to break things down so that students do not become overwhelmed by a task. So this approach can take a few different forms—checklists, rubrics, scheduling schoolwork in calendars, and also looking at specific models of an assignment done well. Neurodivergent students are particularly prone to sensory sensitivities. Taking the extra time to think about how to make your classroom more sensory-friendly can create an environment in which the students are more comfortable and better able to learn. This looks like minimizing clutter on the walls and around the room, having clear and simple signs or labels for all the materials in the classroom, prioritizing natural light, offering alternative seating options, and providing a quiet area somewhere within or right next to the classroom. It’s really important to engage in ongoing conversation with the other adults who live and work with the neurodivergent students in your classroom. So parents, school psychologists, counselors, school librarians, social workers, the special ed teachers, any specialists that are in or outside the classroom that work with those students because they can provide really valuable insight and support, and that way you can address issues before they escalate into bigger problems. If we take a strengths-based approach to supporting neurodivergent students, then we create more opportunities for them throughout the year to shine. And the more opportunities to shine they get, the better.

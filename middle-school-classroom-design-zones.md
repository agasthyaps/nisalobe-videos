“There are so many things in education that you cannot control,” says David LaMaster, assistant principal of curriculum at West Side Middle School in Charleston, West Virginia. “One of the things you can control, though, is the setup of your classroom. Defining specific areas will create a learning environment that promotes positive interactions and maximizes student achievement.” To read more on LaMaster’s tips for classroom design, check out his Edutopia article “ Key Areas of Middle School Classrooms .”

## Transcript

David LaMaster: It’s a fact—students will arrive to class without supplies. Having a prominently displayed, well-stocked takeoff area will address this problem. They can pick up pencils, paper, or anything else they need. This will decrease unnecessary disruptions during instruction and lead to more time on task. At the end of class, students can return unused items to the designated area. For whole group instruction, create your focal point area near your smartboard, whiteboard, or smart TV. Many teachers keep a microphone, speakers, tablet, and stylus in this area. A small desk, podium, and cable clips will help you organize these important devices. When it’s time to address the whole class, you can be confident you have everything you need to communicate effectively. Working with small groups is key to ensuring that all students receive the instruction they need. A rolling caddie or shelves that contain teaching supplies and manipulatives will keep you and your students from leaving the area in search of supplies and losing instructional time. Make sure students are facing away from the class, to minimize distractions and maximize the light bulb moments that teachers love. It can be difficult to keep track of equipment. Shoe organizers are a great way to display and quickly access headphones. Color-coded clips can clean up messy cables and chargers. Labeling technology helps hold students accountable for items they use. Don’t forget to post your internet safety rules and procedures in this area as well, to keep equipment, and most importantly your students, safe. Supplies get lost all too often in the classroom. An organized storage area is your best friend. Don’t overstock: Hoarding supplies will make it harder to find what you need. Think of the materials that you and your students use the most, and place them where they are easily accessible. See-through containers, with labels, are a good choice to store items. Place the heavy items on the bottom and the lighter ones on top. Besides being aesthetically pleasing, bulletin boards can be used to introduce and reinforce new concepts, help with classroom management, give clear expectations, and create effective routines and procedures. Most importantly, bulletin boards can spotlight the exciting work being done by your students. This will make them feel valued and teach them to appreciate the work of others. A space of your own is critical to recharge and handle the other duties of the job, such as grading papers, creating lesson plans, and analyzing data. Consider where your desk would be best placed, and make a list of activities you’ll do there. Gather the materials you need to do those activities and place them accordingly. Keeping your desk free from other items and clutter will help you work at maximum efficiency.

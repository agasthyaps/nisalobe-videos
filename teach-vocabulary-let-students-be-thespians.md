In a 2020 study , 8-year-old students who listened to words in another language and then used their hands and bodies to mimic the words were up to 73 percent more likely to remember them—even after two months—compared to students who listened without an accompanying gesture. Researchers discovered similar results when students were asked to look at pictures while listening to the corresponding foreign-language vocabulary.

## Transcript

Do you know the German word for airplane? A new study suggests that if you spread your arms and act it out while listening to the word “flugzeug,” you’re more likely to remember it. In the study, 8-year-old students who listened to words in another language, and then used their hands and bodies to mimic them, were up to 73% more likely to remember even after two months. Researchers discovered similar results when students were asked to look at corresponding pictures while learning new vocabulary. There’s nothing magical about pictures and gestures, though. The research is just another reminder that if you want students to remember something, encourage them to learn it in a variety of ways: by drawing it, acting it out, pairing it with relevant images, or even building something with it.

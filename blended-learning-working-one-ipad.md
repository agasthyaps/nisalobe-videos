## Transcript

Working With One iPad (Transcript) Kristin: I will load up three or four problems and I’ll have them in pairs. I’ll hand them the one iPad. It is possible to actually use one iPad and get this done in a class, ’cause that’s all I have. And I’ll say, “All right, you teach him how to do this problem.” And you can get help from the person next to you if you need it. It’s okay, it’s a team process.

Student: MD is twenty-one and D equals RD.

Kristin: When they’re finished, I save it and then I’ll pull up a problem very similar to it, and I’ll hand it to their partner. And say, “Okay, now it’s your turn, you do the same thing.” Okay, this is a question. Make sure you read the question carefully.

Student: Thank you.

Kristin: Okay. And they hand it back to me, I make sure it’s all saved and then I move on to another pair.

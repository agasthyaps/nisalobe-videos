## Article

To support students as they navigate everyday conflicts, Fall-Hamilton Elementary has a nook called a peace corner in every room, with a comfortable seat, a timer, and some distractions, like stuffed animals or a form on which students can explicitly document their feelings and reactions. This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Fall-Hamilton Elementary .

## Transcript

Teacher: What were you all discussing?

Student: Nothing.

Teacher: I’ve seen a lot of my kids this year, instead of just exploding, getting really upset they are aware of their emotions and before lashing out they will be like, “Okay, I need to go to the peace corner.” Mathew Portell: At Fall Hamilton we have students who are currently experiencing some serious tragedy in their lives. When they walk through the door they don’t leave everything at the door, they bring it with them.

Teacher: Do you need to take a break? Yeah?

Mathew Portell: We’re trying to build the capacity for them to be able to know what to do when they’re frustrated or when they’re angry. So we’re using peace corners.

Madisien Steele: There is a peace corner in every classroom. That is a place that a student can go if they need a break. If they just need a time out, they’re having a hard time. There’s gonna be some comfy pillows or a bean bag. There’ll be some fidgets. Different things to help de-escalate the student.

Abby: If I get really frustrated and feel like I’m gonna yell or get mad at somebody, I go to the peace corner and just calm down.

Whitney Holland: We set a five minute timer so they know that they have five minutes to cool down. If it’s really bad and they need some extra time I said they can flip it again and take their time.

Abby: My teacher has this sheet that you fill out. It tells you how you feel, what choice you made, and what should you do to make it better next time.

Madisien Steele: There’s also gonna be some charts that talk about breathing or counting or different things a student can do to de-escalate in the moment. At the end of that time it’s time to reintegrate with the rest of the students.

Mathew Portell: Every kid uses it so it’s not a place of stigma. It’s a place that we allow students to utilize the strategies that we’re teaching them.

Whitney Holland: Ready to go? Seen a huge shift in just behavior. There’s not as many outbursts, there’s not as many arguments ’cause they’ve realized their emotions, they’re understanding them, and they’re able to make that decision to go sit down at the peace corner.

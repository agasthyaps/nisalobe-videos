## Article

At P.S. 249, the Caton School, in Brooklyn, New York, every student from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade has the opportunity to go “book shopping” each week. Principal Elisa Brown has prioritized Title I funding to ensure that each classroom has its own library filled with thousands of chapter and picture books for students to choose from, both fiction and nonfiction. Teachers pair students at similar reading levels to browse the collection together and help hold each other accountable, then give them a time slot during the school day to select anywhere from four to 10 books.

The classroom libraries are continually updated based on student interest, and books are often connected to what they are learning in class. And the best part? Students get to bring their books home on loan each week, in a special book baggie designed to track and protect the books, which encourages a love of reading, allows them to share their interests with their families, and strengthens reading skills at home and at school.

## Transcript

Girl: So, what do you think we should pick? Ana de Jesus: Book shopping creates a reading life not just within the school building, but it creates a reading life at home. And we know that many of our homes don’t have books. So, providing kids with books builds love of reading.

Girl: So, I’m going to choose this book for me.

Girl: This book seems interesting, too.

Elisa Brown: At P.S. 249, I want the kids to have access to books, because it unlocks many doors. I use Title I funds. I buy less workbooks so that I have money for actual books that children can read. Ana de Jesus: Each of our classrooms has their own classroom libraries with anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 books. Kids are able to shop weekly.

Lissette Lara: So, book shopping is a time for kids to select books to read throughout the week. Kids have the opportunity to find something that they have a connection to. Something they’re interested in learning about.

Lissette Lara: I’m going to have Elma and Anthony come with your book baggie, and you have your eight minutes to book-shop, OK?

Lissette Lara: So, the students are paired based on their levels of reading. They hold each other accountable. Like they’re not reading a book that is too low for their level or too high. They’re very accustomed to talking about the books. They recommend books to one another.

Anthony: The book is about magic. It’s a really good one. You should read it.

Lissette Lara: The way I organize my library, I like to break it up in fiction, nonfiction, and then high interest. Every year is different. One year, kids are really drawn to space. Another year, technology. So, I have to feel the class.

Anthony: So, I’m going to choose something about soccer.

Elma: I’ve got all of my books. How about you?

Anthony: Yeah, me, too.

Lissette Lara: OK, I’m going to call Dianna and Veronise, drop the books that you have finished, and keep the books that you are going to continue reading this week.

Lissette Lara: When they are not sure what to choose, then my role is, like, to step in and make those recommendations.

Dianna: My teacher knows that I like poems. I like the deep meanings and fancy language they have. She recommended me a book. I read the blurb on the back. It was a poem about the pandemic started.

Dianna: I connect to the book because it—my mother got also sick. And I’m like the author, I got worried.

Lissette Lara: So, you have to tell me when you finish your final thought, OK?

Dianna: OK.

Lissette Lara: Because I really enjoyed this book, also.

Dianna: OK.

Lissette Lara: We also have Dear Future Reader, where they get a Post-it and they write their notes inside of the cover.

Dianna: When I read them, I get, like, interested in reading it more.

Lissette Lara: And that’s like gold for them. Like, “Oh, my God, someone left me this here. I’m part of this club, right? Because now I have the book and I know something about the book that no one else knows.” Lissette Lara: OK, chicas. We’re done?

Girl: Yeah.

Lissette Lara: All right, cool.

Lissette Lara: So, the book baggies are what we use to keep the books together.

Elisa Brown: They come home every day with books to practice their reading, to try out the strategies they’ve learned during Reading Workshop.

Lissette Lara: It’s important for the kids to take their books home, because they haven’t read enough in school, right? And they’re like, “Oh, my God, I want to finish this book.” They share what they are learning with their parents, with their younger siblings, with their grandmother. It develops this pathway of learning and a love for reading.

## Article

Spanish teacher Jamie Midyette understands just how taxing learning a language can be. At times in her class at Albert Hill Middle School in Richmond, Virginia, she sees her students lose eye contact, look sleepy, or get distracted. It’s at those times when she knows to turn to a valuable tool for her world language learners: brain breaks.

These short games, requiring anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes, offer several benefits. They involve movement, getting students out of their seats. They encourage interaction and eye contact among students who may not run in the same social circles.

Students who win the brain break are recognized, celebrated with applause, and given a sticker, which boosts confidence and contributes to a positive atmosphere in class. Brain breaks are not just for fun—each one involves ongoing instruction and practice in the target language. Some brain breaks pair gestures with vocabulary words, which is a proven method to help students remember those words.

Though brain breaks are useful in every subject, they have a special utility in a world language classroom. One brain break that Midyette uses is Aguila o Sol (Eagle or Sun), named for the two icons on a Mexican peso and modeled on Heads or Tails. Students put their hands on their heads if they think the coin will land on sun, or on their hips if they think it will land on eagle.

If the student is correct, they stay standing; if not, they sit down. Midyette continues to flip the coin and students continue to choose eagle or sun until only one person remains. Another brain break is Arriba Abajo Mira (Up Down Look), in which students stand in a circle.

If Midyette says, “Arriba,” students look up. If she says, “Abajo,” they look down. And if she says, “Mira,” they look across the circle to another student’s eyes.

If that student is looking back, both are out. The game continues until just two people are left. A third brain break is Más Alto, Más Bajo (Higher or Lower), which involves a deck of cards.

Either Midyette or a student volunteer flips over the top card. Everyone else stands in a line circling the room, and one person approaches and decides if they think the next card in the deck will be higher or lower. If they’re correct, they join the end of the line.

If not, they sit down. Students continue to circle around and guess higher or lower until one student remains. Pasa la Bola (Pass the Ball) is another brain break that involves movement and vocabulary review.

One student, the guesser, exits the classroom and doesn’t see who has a ball behind their back. When the guesser returns, everyone else makes a circle around them and secretly passes the ball from one to another behind their backs. The guesser asks students in the circle, “Do you have it?” in Spanish, and the others answer either “No, I don’t have it,” or “Yes, I have it.” The game continues until just one or two people are left.

Within a 90-minute period, Midyette includes three or four brain breaks, creating natural transitions between activities and lessons. Though students may be losing focus before a brain break, their energy level afterward is quite different—they’re energized, happy, and ready to return to the lesson with renewed attention. The Pass the Ball brain break and the Spanish adaptation of Rock, Paper, Scissors were sourced from Anabelle Williamson of La Maestra Loca , and the Higher or Lower brain break was originated by Amy Marshall.

## Transcript

Jamie Midyette (speaking in Spanish): Because we have brain breaks, I see connection between students. I see understanding of another language and of another culture, and I see a return of the focus to be continued throughout the rest of the class. Students’ brains are working very, very hard when they’re listening to another language and reading another language, and it can be mentally exhausting for them. I might start seeing them look sleepy or lose their eye contact, and so when I do a brain break, it grabs their attention, it gets them excited, it allows them to interact with their classmates. When they come back to the lesson, I have their eye contact again, I have their attention again. They’re energized, they’re ready to continue learning. I heard about this brain break as Heads or Tails, but then I happened to have a Mexican peso. On one side there’s the Aztec sun calendar, and on the other side is the eagle. So instead of heads or tails, I called it eagle or sun. (Speaking in Spanish.) Students put their hands on their hips if they’re guessing that it will land on eagle, and they put their hands on their heads if they think it’s going to land on the sun. Yes, sol. Then if they win, they remain standing. If they lose, they take a seat, and we keep narrowing it down until there’s one winner.

Adelaide: Games like that have motions attached to them, and those definitely help the vocabulary stick in our brain better.

Jamie Midyette: We know that movement helps with learning too. A lot of times when the students are moving, they remember words better. Another brain break is Arriba, Abajo, Mira. Up, down, look. Up in Espanol? Group of Students: Arriba .

Jamie Midyette: Arriba. Down in Espanol? Group of Students: Abajo .

Jamie Midyette: Abajo . Look? Group of Students: Mira .

Jamie Midyette: Mira . (Speaking in Spanish.) Jamie Midyette: I say “Arriba,” which means up, and the kids look up, and then I say “Abajo,” which means down, and they look down at the floor, and then I say, “Mira,” which means look, they have to look at another person in the circle, straight in the eyes, and if the person is looking back at them, they’re both out. And we narrow it down until there’s one or two people left.

Jamie Midyette: I think that one is super-special because oftentimes you’re looking at a student that may not run in the same social circles, but you’re looking at them in the eye and you’re acknowledging them as another human being and a classmate. (Speaking in Spanish.) Jamie Midyette: One of the great things about brain breaks is that eventually the students want to lead the brain breaks, and so they take over the teacher role, which is really fun for them, and it’s also fun for me to watch. (Speaking in Spanish.) With Más Alto, Más Bajo, higher or lower, I would have one student sitting in kind of a special chair and flip over the top card. The first person in line looks at the card, and then they guess if they think the next card is going to be higher or lower than that card. (Speaking in Spanish.) And if they’re right, they continue walking in the circle and come back around, stay in the game. But if they’re not right, they take a seat and they continue guessing and walking around the circle until there’s only one person left. (Speaking in Spanish.) Jamie Midyette: Another brain break is (Speaking in Spanish) Pass the Ball. One person leaves the classroom and doesn’t know who has the ball. OK. (Speaking in Spanish.) So they come in and then the other students form a circle around that one person, and the person has to address people in the circle and ask in Spanish, “Do you have it?” Group of Students: (Speaking in Spanish.) Jamie Midyette: Meanwhile, they’re also passing the ball behind their backs around the circle to try to avoid having the ball in their hands when they’re asked the question. It keeps going until the person in the middle discovers who has the ball. Group of Students: (Speaking in Spanish.) Jamie Midyette: (Speaking in Spanish.) Adelaide: Doing these brain breaks can help people relax, feel more calm. If I’m having a bad day and then we do a brain break, I usually automatically feel better. It gets my head in the right space to learn.

Jamie Midyette: I try to do three or four brain breaks in a 90-minute class, so every 15 to 20 minutes we’re getting up. Sometimes the brain breaks are 30 seconds, sometimes they might be two minutes. But all the time that I am investing in the brain breaks comes back to reward me in the end because I have the students’ attention and happiness. Group of Students: (Speaking in Spanish.) Jamie Midyette: (Speaking in Spanish.) OK.

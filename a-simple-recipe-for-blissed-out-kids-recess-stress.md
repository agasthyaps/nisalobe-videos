# A Simple Recipe for Blissed-Out Kids

> A 2025 study showed that more recess time means less stress for students, suggesting that play is not just a nice-to-have—it’s essential.

How can schools help move kids from stressed out to blissed out? A study published in June 2025 made the case once again for the power of recess to reduce stress and support students’ mental and physical health and well-being. Schools in the U.S. used to prioritize outdoor play, frequently allotting 60 minutes daily for recess to ensure that students were happy and healthy, the researchers say.

But as academic demands grew steadily higher over the years, recess time was reduced to make room for expanded seat time and more testing. In parallel, levels of stress and anxiety in children have been on the rise. Researchers wanted to explore the connection between reduced playtime and chronic stress in children.

They worked with six public schools in north Texas that had been using a longitudinal recess intervention designed by the LiiNK Center for Healthy Play for six years—three of the schools had 45 minutes of daily outdoor recess and the other three had only 30 minutes of play. After collecting hair samples from 130 fourth-grade students, the researchers analyzed the strands for cortisol levels, a biological marker of chronic stress, and found that children with extended recess had 68 percent less cortisol present, indicating that they were significantly more relaxed. These findings led the researchers to advocate for frequent, unstructured, outdoor recess, adding their voices to a growing body of evidence that supports the benefits of independent play.

For example, in 2023, a comprehensive study reviewed over 50 years of historical data and concluded that children in the past not only spent more time outdoors, but they gained long-term benefits from engaging in activities without direct adult supervision. Returning to an era of more recess time could alleviate stress and enhance children’s well-being. The study underscores the need to prioritize play in school schedules, potentially reversing the trend of reduced recess and its negative impacts on young people’s mental health and development.

For happier, healthier, more socially competent children, more recess could be the key. To read the original research, check out the links below: Deborah J. Rhea, Kelsey Kirby, Dennis Cheek, Yan Zhang, and G.

## Transcript

Narrator: Decades ago, according to a 2025 study, the US had a simple philosophy on school recess. Adults recognized outdoor play as vital for happy and healthy children, and schools set aside 60 minutes for recess every day. Since then, the researchers say, a creeping tide of academic expectations has led to more seat time and more testing, raising anxiety levels in young children and undermining the quality and quantity of free play in schools. Unless something changes, the gloom may stick around. To test a theory linking a lack of playtime to chronic stress in kids, the researchers conducted a novel experiment, dividing 130 fourth graders into two groups, one with 45 minutes of outdoor recess daily, the other with only 30. Hair samples of the children were then analyzed for cortisol levels, providing a unique biological measure of chronic rather than short-term stress. Students in the extended recess group had 68% less cortisol stored in their hair strands. From head to toe, they were far more relaxed. Despite the surprising results, the researchers—who say that recess should be frequent, unstructured, and outdoors—aren’t really going out on a limb. More independent play yields happier, more socially competent children, according to an ever-expanding body of evidence. An exhaustive 2023 study, for example, combed through over 50 years of historical records and concluded that kids in the past spent more time outdoors and derived long-term benefits from opportunities to “play, roam, and engage in other activities independent of direct oversight and control by adults.” On the question of recess, it might just be time to turn back the clock.

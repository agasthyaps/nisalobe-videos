## Transcript

Teacher: In today’s lesson, we’re going to take a look at more applications of exponential functions. Have a quick peek at our roles and our groups.

Student: Every day in class we are assigned a table group. We get to work with a bunch of different people.

Teacher: We’re going to go ahead and randomize you guys here.

Student: And you’re assigned roles.

Student: I’m the scribe.

Student: The scribe is the person who’s writing down what you’re thinking. The speaker is the one who’s presenting your information. The inquirer is someone going up to our teacher whenever your group has a question, and then the manager, they’re in charge of the materials, and making sure that everyone is on task. And then we need to write a key at the top. Our teacher is walking around the room and seeing how we’re collaborating.

Teacher: Nice.

Student: And then at the end, he calls on different groups.

Student: The simple interest had more money in the account.

Teacher: Yeah.

Student: When we’re doing assigned roles, everyone is involved in answering a problem. That definitely helps making sure that you can grasp concepts.

## Transcript

Woman: Everything we do at Wooranna revolves around children. We foster their interest and their voice and make them feel that they are powerful, no matter how old they are.

Ray: We’ve tried to create this environment that is exciting for kids. The Reggio Emilia philosophy underpins our thinking.

Student: The sun is here, and the moon is here. So the planet earth is moving around slowly.

Sapna: In Reggio Emilia, they believe that each child is born with 100 languages. Each child have a different language to express themselves and they feel comfortable with. A child’s language could be drama. Could be music, singing. Could be construction, making things. If a child is not confident with writing, they can express themselves through drawing. So how can we support each child?

Teacher: If you want to write and then draw, that’s fine. However you want to express it. Yeah?

Ray: We try to create an environment where each of those languages can be expressed within a school.

Sapna: We want to create spaces with stimulating materials that a child would want to interact with. So we treat environment as a third teacher.

Student: Give me more of these blocks.

Ray: The first two teachers are obviously the home and the school and the third teacher is the environment. We provide environments where children are more relaxed, with different seating areas, little cubbies here and there. But basically, it’s something to excite children’s learning, particularly learning through play.

Teacher: Delicious. How did you know chocolates are my favorite?

Filippos: Pretty much in every year level, there’s a special place. The starship is here in year three. We’ve got the dragon boat in year two.

Aaron: The dragon boat is where a lot of technology is situated. So there is a computer lab. Also, there’s an upstairs area called the dreamtime space. There’s aboriginal stories and then, if you go forward, there is the mast of the dragon boat.

Teacher: Can you see now?

Student: I’m a astronaut.

Teacher: First, look up a bit higher.

Aaron: There’s also the spaceship in grade three. Up at the front of the spaceship, there is a flight simulator. In the middle, it has the interactive white board.

Teacher: What do you need here, then?

Aaron: And at the back, it has another computer lab.

Teacher: What are you creating on Minecraft to show how you’re going to– Ray: The father of Reggio Emilia, Loris Malaguzzi, says nothing without fun. If it’s fun, if it’s something that children want to do, children will pursue it. I would like to think that children come to school not because they have to come to school but because they really want to come.

## Article

Teachers at Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School work together in small groups to support each other and ensure that academic expectations and behavior standards are consistently high across the school. The school’s non-negotiables and core values are posted prominently all over the campus to reinforce their values. This video is part of our series on integrated social, emotional, and academic development in Nashville and features key practices from Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School .

## Transcript

Upbeat Music Voiceover: We as a teaching staff, we’re going to learn best when we learn from each other.

Rachael Hunt: It was there, they just don’t trust themselves Voiceover: Because we participate in small groups called flocks, we have this profound sense that we’re not alone in this work. Upbeat music Dr.

Sonia Stewart: At Pearl-Cohn, we have a really clear structure, because when you’re consistent room to room, hallway to hallway, academy to academy, kids know what to expect, and so they feel safe within that structure, and are quicker to learn.

Jessica Hansen: I feel like we’ve built a culture of you know what the expectation is. The flock was developed by a group of teachers born out of the idea that we want consistency across the board, also the level and rigor of instruction.

Teacher: Part of the goal is teamwork and making sure that everyone participates, right?

Jessica Hansen: We are really clear about our expectations, so we have five core values. They are in every hallway and in every classroom. So they see it all the time, and they hear it all the time. We also have non-negotiables that are really specific. We always look for; are we promoting the core values within our classrooms and are we holding kid to behavioral expectations called the non-negotiables. So the flock was born out of trying to gain a consistency classroom to classroom with those expectations for kids. Alright you guys know what’s expected of you today, correct?

Students: Yes.

Marqo Patton: We took a model of looking at peer feedback and how we could really support each other for the sake of our kids we have teachers of various disciplines and various years of experience. We’re looking at classroom behavior, classroom culture. Looking at those core values we can kind of check off what’s being adhered to, or broken. The rubric is both qualitative and quantitative. So you’re able to write notes on what you see and writing that evidence down to have more meaningful conversations. And then we talk about what we’ve seen. When we look at the core values, a lot of what we saw was evidence of others first. Just how they responded to each other was a sure example of that. So having that conversation is really helpful, because we get a lot of feed back.

Rachael Hunt: You watched hands go like this.

Marqo Patton: But as they were talking to each other you see some of the hands kind of slide down.

Rachael Hunt: They feel like there should be a right or a wrong, but you’re trying to get them to see their own identity, and I think that that’s where you’re pushing them.

Jessica Hansen: When I get feedback from my colleagues, like, “hey immediately you had three or four table groups that raises their hand,” I now am more aware going into another class am I answering that question, or am I posing another question that allows the student to dig deeper. You guys are working, you’ve got 15 to 20 minutes.

Marqo Patton: We’ve seen just huge reductions in off task behaviors Student: What about rays?

Jessica Hansen: I think one of the biggest benefits to the consistency is there’s a common language, when a kid hears me say, “good job, you really showed grit there and persevered through it.” And they go to another classroom and they hear the same thing, there’s no confusion. We are able to instill in them a changed perspective. It allows us to access the resources that are already in them, going, “hey you have this great capacity to learn, and grow.” Student: I’m not going to say it defines who I am, but to the world, yes.

# Boosting Confidence With Student-Driven Math

> When teachers noticed a lack of autonomy in the math classroom, a switch to a student-centered curriculum bumped up ownership of learning—and the kids’ ability to talk about their problem-solving approach.

At Van Ness Elementary, in Washington, DC, educators adopted the Illustrative Math curriculum to move the onus for developing problem-solving skills onto the students and saw a powerful shift in the discourse in their math classrooms.

## Transcript

Katherine McQuain: In today’s lesson, you’re going to be solving a few mysteries.

Class: Oooh, mysteries! McQuain: You have some number lines. McQuain: Because we’ve made the switch to this curriculum where students have the ownership for their math learning, we have seen such an increase in students’ math confidence. Their ownership for their learning. They know that when they’re presented with a problem, they have a toolbox of strategies, and they will choose what works for them.

Girl: I got 38! Cynthia Robinson-Rivers: Van Ness is a public school in the Southeast area of Washington, DC. We believe when you give children autonomy and choice, they are so much more motivated to engage in the learning. We had a math curriculum that was strong and that was the standard approach in many schools, which is, “I do”—the teacher does something, shows the kids. “We do. We do it together. I give you some guided practice.” And then “You do.” What we found is that this makes the learners very dependent. And it, in some ways, constrains their thinking. McQuain: You’ll do two on your own, and then you’ll do the rest with a partner that has a different strategy than yours. McQuain: We decided to make this gradual change to Illustrative Math. The heavy lifting, the academic load, is more toward the students, and that more aligns to our core values of giving students autonomy and choice.

Class: Where did I end? McQuain: Students each day are presented with a series of word problems, and my role in this is really just the facilitator. I present the problems to students, but I’m not providing any solutions or providing any suggestions. So, they work at the carpet for a little bit. Think of their own strategies, and then I have them give a thumbs-up signal to say, “I’m done with my work. I’m ready to go compare with a partner.” Girl: What I did was 30 minus 20 equals 13. And that’s where I got my… Boy: I knew that it couldn’t be 40, because 40 plus 40 equals 80. So, then it had 2, so minus the 2 equals 38. So, that’s how I figured out it was 42 plus 3 equals… McQuain: Being at the table is an opportunity to take someone else’s perspective on the problem, get ideas for strategies that they might want to implement, or just to respectfully say, you know, “I see how that strategy worked for you, but it’s not the strategy for me.” Girl: So, 80, so I can count 42 to 80 and I got 38.

Girl: How’d you get 38?

Girl: I counted up with my fingers sort of [inaudible] by using the number line. McQuain: So, they have that partner time at the table, and then we’ll come back to the carpet for whole group. Look at those equations that you’ve solved. Which one was the hardest? Jonathan.

Jonathan: It was something plus 19 equals 67. It was so hard. I kept— McQuain: There’s so much more confidence when you call on students who want to share how they got their answer, not just, “Did you get it? How you got your answer.” Hands go up. They all want to tell you their step-by-step process. And they can explain it really clearly. So, what strategy finally worked for you in the end?

Jonathan: I finally figured out I have to use my number line. McQuain: They’re learning how to put their thinking into words, which was a huge struggle for students with the old curriculum. When they feel like they have responsibility and the onus for the learning in the math classroom, the results are fantastic.

Boy: But the ending number is 80.

Girl: OK, all you have to do is add the 10 and add the 1s together. For instance— Robinson-Rivers: It totally changes discourse in the math classroom. One, gets kids talking instead of just listening, which we know is a better way to learn. Two, it has kids teaching one another. We also know that’s a way to internalize information and understand it even better for yourself after you’ve explained it to others. But most importantly, it gives them many, many strategies. Whether it’s drawing a diagram, using mental math, decomposing, or doing it just the regular old-fashioned way that we know how to do. They’re doing it the way that’s best for them, and then they will be fluent mathematicians.

Boy: That equals 10.

Girl: That’s how I got 13.

Boy: Oh, that makes sense!

Girl: It’s 3 and 3 and then these 10s.

Boy: That makes sense. So.

Girl: I know. [Laughs.]

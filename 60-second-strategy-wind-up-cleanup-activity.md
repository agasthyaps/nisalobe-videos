## Article

In preschool teacher Sarah Dolcin’s class at The Co-op School in Brooklyn, New York, even routine moments can spark imagination and teamwork—like when a quick activity called Wind-Up Cleanup turns tidying the classroom into a joyful, creative experience. Wind-Up Cleanup invites students to pretend they’re cleanup robots, transforming what might otherwise be a chore into a playful act of cooperation. When it’s time to reset the room, Dolcin calls out to the “robots,” and the class freezes in place, waiting for the signal to wind up their motors, and then pretending to twist imaginary keys on their backs until they’re ready to move.

Once “activated,” the robots whir into action—picking up blocks, placing books on shelves, and returning supplies to their bins. Of course, every now and then, a robot might “malfunction.” When that happens, a classmate or the teacher steps in to help “fix” their motor, and the cleanup continues. The game quickly fills the room with laughter and activity, but underneath the play, children are also developing a sense of responsibility.

As Dolcin explains, “They’re using their imagination and creativity, but also practicing ownership of taking care of their space.” By acting out the role of robots, students exercise empathy and collaboration—helping one another, following directions, and taking pride in contributing to the classroom community. Whether Wind-Up Cleanup is used at the end of the day or between activities, it can be a quick, imaginative reset that helps the preschool class transition smoothly while reinforcing positive routines. And because it’s framed as play, students approach the task with enthusiasm—discovering that taking care of their environment can be both meaningful and fun.

## Transcript

Sarah Dolcin: We are going to become robots; wind-up cleaning robots. But first… Wind-Up Cleanup makes cleaning fun with a twist. In this game, the students are practicing their ownership of taking care of their space. First, we freeze. Once you get wind-up, we’re going to start cleaning our books. And then we wind them up. I’ll wind you up. And we’re just imagining that they have a motor on their backs. And then once it’s turned on, they can start cleaning.

Student: I am cleaning up.

Sarah Dolcin: Let’s clean.

Sarah Dolcin: Sometimes we’ll say, like, “Oh no, we’re malfunctioning.” And then either a friend or a teacher can help wind them up as well, and then they’ll go back into the task. They can use their imagination and they can use their creativity and be in a different world as they’re cleaning.

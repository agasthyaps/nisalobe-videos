## Transcript

Teacher: Ooh, look at this one.

Linda: Learning opportunities are everywhere, and our brains are always learning. And so the question is, how do we capitalize on the environment that we’re in and support kids to take those challenges, see the connections, learn with joy and with passion and encouragement? Whether you’re learning in or out of school, you want certain things in the environment. You want psychologically safe and physically safe learning environments. You want positive relationships that are encouraging to students. You want the opportunities for scaffolding, like learning skills in small steps with supports.

Karen: Afterschool in community settings provide much more flexible opportunities for learning. They’re not necessarily grouped by age. They’re more flexible in terms of time. The spaces are more varied. Outdoor spaces, recreation spaces, art spaces.

Teacher: Well, hello, madam. Your buddies are waiting for you. Take off your coat, and then she’s been waiting for you all day.

Karen: Relationships and belonging are where learning begins. If we don’t feel that we are in a situation in which we are safe and supported and known, we shut down. We go into either fight or flight or freeze. We don’t bring our full selves in. So the first thing that has to happen is that we really need to feel that this is a place, this is a group of young people and adults, with whom we can relax, so that we can be ready to be challenged and learn, and practice, and bring in what we know.

Keyasia: We look for energetic, positive youth who are passionate about helping kids change and grow. Typically college age students so that the kids will see someone that they can look up to and like, “Oh, I can do that one day.” Karen: All of this starts with young people’s assessment of whether they can trust the adults, because it immediately determines for them how much of themselves they bring into that experience. That’s what the science tells us, and so it really flips this to put the burden on us to make sure adults understand the power that they have to really help young people become empowered learners.

Chaya: To build relationships on the island, we’re letting them know what to expect. Building that trust, so that they feel comfortable. Creating that structure and that support system for students to be able to explore the natural world. They’re able to take risks, they’re able to try new things in a way that really works for them and their learning needs.

Linda: Emotion and learning are tightly connected. When you’re in a joyful space, the enjoyment, the curiosity, the interest actually propels more development of brain architecture and more learning. We know from learning science that pursuing passions and interests actually provokes a deeper sort of learning that is more sustainable over time, produces a lot more retention and application of skills, and transfer of skills to other areas. Pursuing these kinds of passion projects, if you will, can teach a lot of social and emotional skills, including focus and attention, but also collaboration skills, problem solving skills, resilience, growth mindset, the capacity to see obstacles and get past them. All of those things are social and emotional abilities that get developed in these settings.

Carla: We’ve been able to work with a variety of partners to understand the power of having a whole child, a competent, academically-prepared, socially emotionally strong student.

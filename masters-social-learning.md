> We’re hardwired from birth to decode facial expression, posture, and tone of voice—and to work collaboratively.

## Transcript

Dr Patricia Kuhl: There’s areas of the brain that track the human face and other areas that track just eyes, or track just the voice, or track the smile, track the disposition of your face and body, so that we’re exquisitely attuned to the attitude of the human being that you’re interacting with. We know that we start this way. When you look at the studies on very young human babies, even newborns, newborns are captivated by the human face. And newborns at birth have the ability to imitate the facial postures of another person. So they open their mouths when you open your mouth and they stick out their tongue when you stick out your tongue. Eye gaze looks as though it’s one of the most critical features of our social brains. Without realizing it, we do a lot of looking at what the other person’s eyes are doing. If you look at the kids who are very good at following the gaze of another person, their language skills speed much more quickly to a higher level than the children who are not following eye gaze. So, the ability to track eye gaze and the tendency to do so boosts learning tremendously. So why should teachers care about this information? There’s a learning opportunity here. You can create a moment of real synergy that creates better learning for all, when children are put together in small groups so that they have the opportunity to track the information that attracts others. Building classrooms and class attitudes that say, “We’re going to do this together. “We’re going to work in pairs or in groups “and we’re going to solve problems collaboratively,” means that you’re allowing this face-to-face interaction to thrive, to let the brains of the children implicitly learn from the signals that are automatically there when we interact with one another.

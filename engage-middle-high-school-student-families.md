Narrator : Partnering with families is key for long-term student achievement and success, but in many cases, family engagement tapers off as students get older, and there may be deep equity issues at play. Not all families have the same amount of flexibility or resources to engage with schools. So how can secondary school leaders create a sense of belonging for all families in the school community? It can be difficult to get to know families when your teachers are juggling six classes instead of one. Send a survey home in the first weeks with questions about each teen’s strengths and skills, the family’s expectations and goals for the upcoming year, and any hesitations or fears. Your teachers can review these together and refer to them as needed. As the year unfolds, ask your staff to consider making positive phone calls home a regular habit. When teachers draw attention to students’ strengths, it can dramatically improve on-task behavior and decrease disruptions, and routine touch points strengthen the family-to-school partnership. Even with the best intentions, a traditional open house with dry presentations at podiums can leave families and teachers feeling bored and disconnected. Create a more social event where families, educators, staff, and community partners can meet and mingle freely. Set up various stations hosted by relevant groups to provide information about volunteer opportunities and school initiatives. This memorable welcome to the school year not only encourages curiosity and engagement, it also fosters genuine community development and connection. Though it takes considerable planning, one powerful way to strengthen the family-school partnership is to make home visits a part of your school culture. Set aside strategic times during the year for visits, and create a system where grade-level or subject teams divide up the visits to keep it manageable. Give families the option to meet in a neutral zone like a coffee shop. These visits should not focus on grades or behavior, rather on getting to know the family and sharing concrete examples of how teachers have seen the students shine. Students and families will feel known, welcomed, and connected to their school when a teacher or admin takes the time to meet them and understand more about their lives. Sustaining a strong connection between school and home as students get older is worth the extra time and effort to boost student achievement and build a more productive and engaged school community.

## Article

At Barbara Morgan STEM Academy in Meridian, Idaho, project-based learning (PBL) is a schoolwide approach for grades K–5. At every grade level, students participate in projects four times throughout the school year. Each project integrates multiple subject areas, and teachers work collaboratively to design meaningful, standards-aligned learning experiences that give students a clear purpose for what they’re learning—and how they’ll apply it.

A key part of managing these complex PBL units is a learning map, a tool that helps teachers break down an essential question and identify the academic skills that students will need to master the content at hand. The district carves out weekly planning time for all teachers, and each Wednesday, Kim Miller and her second-grade team have the opportunity to discuss their current PBL unit and check it against the learning map. They analyze progress, identify gaps, and plan activities—always keeping their essential question at the center.

The concept of learning maps is adapted from Jim Knight’s 2013 book, High-Impact Instruction: A Framework for Great Teaching . When Barbara Morgan STEM Academy teachers did a book study on the text a few years back, they adopted the practice to make it work for their school. “We map out our instructional plan, but we also use it for students as their road map to see where their learning is going,” says Miller.

In a weekly meeting about their Properties of Materials project, the teachers discussed how to move students from identifying properties of solids, liquids, and gasses to identifying properties of materials. Their solution? A chocolate lab, where students used different types of chocolate to practice observation, data collection, and critical thinking—all while engaging with core science standards.

And because the science was connected to candy, student enthusiasm and engagement soared. For more resources for PBL planning, read Tara Koehler and John Sammon’s article for Edutopia, “ Breaking Down the Complex Work of Teaching PBL Into Manageable Chunks .”

## Transcript

Kim Miller: Now we actually have to collect the data, right? And write it in the box. So, that will be how you’re going to carry out today’s investigation. We want to develop kids that are great learners and great thinkers. As a project-based-learning school, we’re very intentional about always going back to our essential question, and seeing what skills do they need and how they acquire them. We map it out on our instructional plan, but we also use it for students as their road map to see where their learning is going. What else did you notice about the wrapping?

Students: It’s bumpy.

Kim Miller: It was bumpy?

Students: It was bumpy.

Katie Mittleider: We are a PBL school—that’s a project-based-learning school. Our projects are done at every grade level.

Students: Even if it doesn’t work out, we’re just not going to give up.

Katie Mittleider: PBL is really challenging. We have a huge focus in our building with our teachers. They collaborate and plan very closely. I think that it’s really important to carve out that time for them so that they can effectively get kids to work through a project.

Kim Miller: We need to have a discussion about the project plan. We have collaboration time districtwide once a week. Our ultimate outcome is a packaging contest. They have a piece of chocolate and a hard candy, and their challenge is to develop a package for each of those candies. So, our essential question is, how can we use properties of materials to solve problems? We use a learning map to map out the skills that the kids need in order to answer that question. So, when you look at the background skills underneath of that, kids have to be able to understand useful properties of materials. One thing we need to talk through this, how can we start to get them moving from identifying properties and observations of solids, liquids, and gases into how do you observe properties of different materials? So, that’s where we came up with, let’s try something with the chocolate. They need the background knowledge for our packaging. We have got to do some observing of chocolate to see what else we can learn about it, right? What are some things that we could observe?

Students: Like the texture, if it’s smooth, rough, bumpy.

Kim Miller: With the chocolate lab, it was guiding them through how do I observe things? How do I compare different materials to see what my results are going to be? And then now what new questions do I have, and what new investigations do I need to do? I’m going to bring you a piece of paper that has a blank chart. We’re going to fill out our chart with these things that you already identified as things you want to observe.

Students: It’s like medium. Yeah, medium. Medium sizes. How do you spell “medium”?

Kim Miller: So, we’re taking that science standard, like a property of a material, and we’re trying to bring it to their level and show them where it is in their real world. And we’re really working on the science and engineering practices. How do we act like a scientist? How do we ask good questions? How can we make good observations? How can we organize our thinking? How can we plan investigations? And it’s always dialing back to why are we learning what we’re learning? So, having that learning map really helps to be able to do that.

Students: Oh, it made— And then the inside— —a mark on it. So, the wrapper— It made the mark inside. Yeah. The wrapper made the mark on the inside. Yeah. And then…

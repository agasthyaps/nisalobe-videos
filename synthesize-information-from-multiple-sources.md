## Article

At Whiting Lane Elementary School , in West Hartford, Connecticut, a commitment to student-centered learning drives all instructional decisions. Principal Karen Kukish says teachers put a lot of effort into preparing and organizing their lesson plans in ways that will address the needs of their diverse population of learners, balancing high expectations with tailored supports for each child. For challenging academic tasks, teachers often deliver instruction through different modalities to engage more learners.

For example, teacher Gloria Torres facilitated a hands-on workshop for her third graders to help them practice synthesizing information from multiple sources. For a recent geography project, students had selected a region in the United States to research. To prepare for an informational writing task, they were asked to synthesize their paraphrased notes from two different sources, in order to create a cohesive narrative.

Torres typed up their handwritten notes, cut them into strips that each contained a researched fact, and distributed them in bags to pairs of students, along with a printed list of transition words and a piece of construction paper. During the activity, students discussed different possibilities of grouping the facts, moving and manipulating the strips of information, and eventually arranging them in a logical order. This tactile approach helped them understand how different details fit together.

Once they were satisfied with the order, they glued down the strips and chose transition words from the handout to make sure the final product flowed smoothly. In addition to fostering critical thinking and organizational skills, the exercise encouraged collaboration and peer feedback. Students talked through the placement of information—from fun facts to historical details—with their partner to ensure coherence in their presentations.

Making a complex task like synthesizing information from multiple sources tangible reinforces students’ understanding and makes their higher-level thinking visible to themselves, their peers, and their teacher. “What I love about it is that there’s more than one right answer, right? If you can organize it in the way that your mind thought, ‘This is how it should be organized,’ and you added some transition words, then it will flow,” says Torres.

“I also think it allows them to retain the information a little bit better, because when you’re actually touching it, talking about it, it’s in there more—those pathways are being made.” For more strategies that can help elementary students learn how to synthesize information,check out Laura Lee’s short article for Edutopia, “ Teaching Young Students How to Use Multiple Sources .” Editor’s note: This summary was written with support from Edutopia’s custom AI tool, which prioritizes information from our archive of educational content.

## Transcript

Kid : And then we could put more of the history stuff. Karen Kukish : We really focus on student-centered learning here at Whiting Lane. The bar is set for very high expectations, but we provide the supports that each child needs in order to get there. Gloria Torres : I think that’s a really good idea because it’s talking about food. Karen Kukish : Here at Whiting Lane, there’s a lot of organization that goes into every lesson so that we can meet the needs of all of our diverse learners in the classroom. Gloria Torres : In the last week, you have been putting notes from multiple sources into your own words. Synthesizing, to me, is the blending of the ideas. It’s a higher-level thinking skill. Right? It can’t just be, here’s my Source 1 notes, here’s my Source 2 notes. That’s pretty basic. And it’s essential when you’re talking about informational writing. And yesterday, we started to synthesize those notes. What’s a kid-friendly way of saying “synthesize”? Cora? Cora : Basically blending them together. Gloria Torres : Blending them together so that it would flow. This is a research project, and so they choose the region in the United States that they’d like to research. We had been taking paraphrase notes using two sources. The notes originally were handwritten. I typed them for them. So I thought it was really important for them to be able to put their hands on the details. You have a baggie full of the notes… I cut up the details from Source A and Source B. Each partner group got a bag, and in the bag, there were the details. And they were also given a list of transition words. When you have the strips in front of you, right, and they’re not in order, you’re reading and you’re thinking about, how does this all fit together? Student : Wisconsin is the only state that produces more cranberries than Massachusetts. That’s like a fun fact, I feel like that should go towards the end. Gloria Torres : So I think that the thinking comes by having to see each detail and see how it fits together. Cora : I think we should put it near the resources. Gloria Torres : They were given a piece of construction paper. So once they finished moving the details around, then they glued it down, and then it was a matter of what transition words to make it even more fluent.

Cora: It’s important to get the order right, because if we don’t, one minute we could be talking about farming and the next we could be talking about the climate, and then people would be like, “What?” Gloria Torres : And what I love about it is that there’s more than one right answer, right? If you can organize it in the way that your mind thought, this is how it should be organized, and you added some transition words, then it will flow. I also think that it allows them to retain the information a little bit better, because when you’re actually touching it, you’re actually talking about it. It’s in there more. Those pathways are being made. Karen Kukish : They can really collaborate together and question one another and give each other feedback. Student : Should this go over to the Massachusetts side? Karen Kukish : And really perform a very difficult task for a third grader in terms of synthesizing information from different sources and making sense of it together and putting it into an order in order to complete the learning task. Student : I’m thinking we could put it near the Basketball Hall of Fame, because that’s doing history.

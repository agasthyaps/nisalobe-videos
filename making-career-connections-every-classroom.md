## Transcript

Otto: Notice how we’re trying to keep the ruler off of the ink. Good deal.

Patrice: Because students are doing real authentic work, a light goes on. And they suddenly realize, “Wow, this is an actual career that I’m learning skills that I could apply in the real world.” Otto: Yeah, that’s a rough photo. Okay, well, what would you do?

Otto: The vision at Maplewood Richmond Heights High School is school is apprenticeship. That’s our motto that we try to implement in as many classes as possible.

Sydney: It’s about getting us ready for what’s after high school. For jobs, college. The school does that by giving us opportunities to do internships, and we also do it within our classes.

Patrice: There are ways that every teacher can put those career options into their course work.

Student: Yeah, I like that. Okay, good, that works!

Patrice: If you’re trying to build a student that has the confidence to go out and work in the real world, they have to be doing real world work. So whenever the task can be something with real stakes, the better.

Otto: Running something like the print shop, they’re beholding to an actual client who is relying on them to have something ready by a certain date.

Otto: All right, guys, take a look up at the board over here. Let’s see, Emily and Andrew, we need those IDs done by October 7th.

Jack: in that class it’s like a job for us. It gives me a chance to see what kind of career I would be getting into if I went that direction.

Otto: We print posters, we create brochures. Anything that a teacher might need in the classroom. And we print all student IDs. They’re learning what it’s like to have an order waiting for you. To have the materials you need to make that, and then go and deliver it to the client. It’s that way from start to finish.

Jack: I learned Photoshop and design. And today I was working on the literary magazine for our school.

Sara: We are interacting with teachers, making sure that we communicate well. “Is this okay? Would you like any adjustments to this?” Otto: Part of their grade actually comes from teacher feedback. “Did you contact the client? Did you come up with a price? Did you do any kind of quality check on it?” If you’re a graphic designer, you wouldn’t survive if you didn’t do those steps.

Otto: Sweet, okay, soon as tint goes in then, you’re ready to rock it.

Patrice: Okay, so let’s get started with the run-through. I think what we need to do is just go through the to-do list and make sure all the logistics are in place.

Patrice: The class that I’m teaching now is about the four cornerstones. Leadership, Stewardship, Scholarship and Citizenship.

Sydney: And the focus of it is to apply our four cornerstones to service projects, so we’re teaching middle schoolers about the four cornerstones. We wanted to get practice speaking and organizing things and really getting a feel for teaching.

Sydney: So the group leader makes sure that you write down the points that they get.

Sydney: Teachers they must work very hard to plan a lessons. Because it took us a couple of weeks to be able to just plan that one day.

Kala: So the day that we taught the students, I was at the Stewardship rotation, focusing on the environment. I had like this pile of things that were either trash or recyclable.

Kala: So can you guys see if you can find the number on that one?

Kala: The experience of teaching, it helped me realize what I wanted to do out of high school. And one of my choices would be Environmental Teaching. It was really fun to get to practice that.

Kala: Okay! Well, good job, you guys got all of them right!

Patrice: I think the benefit for students is it kind of goes back to that old cliché where the student says, “When am I ever going to use this?” They get to see how the skills that they’re learning in class apply in a variety of different contexts.

Jack: If we didn’t do this, I would probably be really lost in what I wanted to do after school. It really helps figure out what kind of work you want to get into and what that looks like.

Otto: That prepares them for college. Or if they were going to go into a trade, it shows them how the real world works.

Otto: Oop, there it goes! Perfect! We’re in business!

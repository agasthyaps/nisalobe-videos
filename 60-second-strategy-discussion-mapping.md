## Transcript

Teacher: Is there somebody in the room that’s got a burning question they’d like to start with?

Student: How do you think this changed Joshua’s perspective?

Teacher: So discussion mapping is a way to give students a visual for the discussion that has taken place in real time. This discussion technique allows them to be able to think deeply and from several perspectives. So the first thing I do is introduce a topic that I want students to focus on. The discussion for today should be– It’s entirely up to the students to keep the discussion moving.

Student: What do you guys think was the clear–?

Teacher: In the meantime, I’m mapping that discussion. I put students on a sheet of paper, and then I literally use a pen and trace from one voice to the other.

Student: Her biggest action was getting on the train.

Teacher: So after a discussion, I show students the map. Take a look at what you accomplished. And then I ask them to debrief. Write down what went well and what needs to change for next time. What does the map show us about how well we talk, how well we listen? They can see their improvement in a very real, visible way.

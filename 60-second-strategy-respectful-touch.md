## Transcript

Teacher: Kindly get together for twinkle time. A lot of times when we talk about touch, we talk about it in a negative way. Don’t touch your friends. Use gentle touches. But they don’t know what a gentle touch is. So every morning, they have this connection. All right, are we ready? First, the kids pair off with someone that they’re comfortable with. Then they just point at each other. That’s establishing eye to eye contact. With bright eyes and nice round cheeks Then they touch each other’s cheeks, then they touch the top of each other’s head, and the top of each other’s feet. Let’s hug our friends. And then they give each other a hug, and that cements the connection between them. All of them have permission, and they know that it’s safe to touch their friends, as long as they’re gentle and respectful.

## Transcript

Teacher: So at this point, we’re going to share our responses. Remember to use your participation cards. So participation cards are a set of index cards which have labels on them. I agree, I disagree, or I don’t know how to respond. We use them to assess students’ understanding, but we also use them to give students voice. So I first pose a question. What was the summary of this excerpt?

Student: The summary of these two pages is that Mrs. Wise is setting Jasmine up to fail.

Teacher: Scholars will listen to the responses and then they will use their participation card.

Student: I respectfully disagree with you. What can the reader infer about Mrs. Wise, based on paragraph two?

Teacher: We obviously cannot have twenty-four scholars speaking at the same time, but we want everyone to feel their ideas matter. Even if I am very shy and I don’t feel comfortable, my voice was still heard.

Integrating visual arts into elementary math lessons can transform the learning experience, combining creativity with problem-solving. Arts integration can make math concepts more accessible and engaging for students, offering a hands-on approach that fosters deeper understanding. Below are four arts-based activities designed to bring math to life in the elementary classroom.

Many of Andy Warhol’s pop art pieces, like his Campbell’s Soup Cans from 1962, can be used to teach multiplication arrays. Students can create their own arrays, picking an image or drawing one of their own, and build multiplication problems based on the repetition in the artwork. Classic works like Vincent van Gogh’s 1889 painting The Starry Night contain myriad shapes that younger students can find and identify.

Elements like the stars, the moon, and the swirls can be highlighted and defined. This activity gets students to recognize and name shapes in the world around them. Students can also explore the symmetry (or lack thereof) in artworks like Frida Kahlo’s 1939 painting The Two Fridas , in which two versions of the artist sit across from one another in mirrored poses but differing clothing.

Since many works of art feature elements of symmetry but don’t match perfectly, they can spark a conversation in the classroom about the definition of symmetry and how it manifests in life and in math problems. Counting and one-to-one correspondence can both be taught using the works of artists like Pablo Picasso or Piet Mondrian. Students can count shapes in their art, identifying the number of rectangles, for instance, or the number of shapes of a certain color.

The ideas for many of these strategies arose from writer and teacher Heather Sanderell’s visits to her local art museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art . Rather than taking a field trip with her math class to the museum, she utilized the institution’s online exhibitions to bring the art into the classroom—encouraging her students to connect the two seemingly disparate subjects of art and math, while boosting their understanding of both.

## Transcript

Heather Sanderell: I’ve always had an interest in the arts. So using arts integration in my classroom has always been a passion point of mine. There are so many similarities between math and the arts. The strategies all stem from engaging students in a way that makes the math more concrete and visual while also eliciting critical thinking skills and creative thinking skills at the same time. A specific group of paintings that really sparked my idea for this project is an Andy Warhol piece. I knew I wanted to use it somehow to teach arrays. It’s similar images over and over again so you can see what you’re counting. So when I did this project, the students were able to choose what they drew and model their pop art arrays and learn then to explain their thinking and how they created their equation. The next strategy that I use is the shape hunt with images of famous works of art. I’ve used Vincent van Gogh’s piece The Starry Night . I would project this on a slide in my classroom and ask students, “What shapes do you see here?” They will point out to me, “On the top right corner, there’s a yellow crescent.” Or they might say that they see a lot of shapes that look like yellow circles. To teach symmetry, first we need to make sure the students know that symmetry is balanced on both sides. Some pieces of artwork show symmetry, but in a way where it’s not exactly perfect or the same image on both sides. With The Two Fridas , you can see that Frida Kahlo modeled one half of the painting after the other. However, the clothing is different. And you can get into discussions about the true definition and when can we say it’s still symmetrical or not. The last strategy that I teach using arts is one-to-one correspondence. And I do so specifically with pieces by Piet Mondrian. So students would look at this piece and say, I see one, two red shapes. And as students become more comfortable with being able to count and keep track of one color shape, or a square versus a rectangle, I could say, “Count how many blue and yellow shapes you see.” And then it builds upon the students’ visual abilities as well as keeping track of two different groups and counting them. So with math combining with art, when you bring the two together, it creates more connections for the students, and it strengthens their knowledge of what they’re seeing. So, I encourage you to check out your local art museums or to get online and look at what the art museums have to offer so you can share those pieces with your students.

The rapidly changing world of AI tools can be challenging territory for educators. For those who decide to engage with it, exploring the benefits that large-language models can bring to the classroom while at the same time ensuring that it’s not detracting from the work of learning can be daunting. There are both ethical and logistical issues to wrestle with around this emerging technology.

But at an elementary school in Meridian, Idaho, one teacher is equipping students with the skills to use AI chatbots in the classroom responsibly—while teaching them to critique the chatbots’ performance at the same time. At Barbara Morgan STEM Academy , all K–5 students participate in a class called STEM Lab each week, just as they take other specials like gym or music. In this week’s lesson, STEM teacher Lynnea Shafter is working with the fifth-grade students to utilize AI to help them develop creative ideas around how to thank crucial community members, like school staff and first responders.

Using the platform MagicSchool AI , Shafter gives students a chance to interact with a custom chatbot to ask for suggestions and, most important, assess the results. After spending some time refining their prompts, students use a rubric to rate the chatbot responses across a number of categories: relevance, clarity, creativity, and ethical considerations. “I want to give them the thinking skills to be really analytical of what they’re using,” says Shafter.

“You have a responsibility when you use it, not just a responsibility to use it the right way but to look at what it gives you and really think about: Is it useful? Is it safe? Is it true?” By asking her fifth-grade students to be thoughtful—and even critical—when they are using AI chatbots in the classroom, Shafter is hoping they will develop a keener sense of digital accountability.

“I want them to start really looking at the information they’re given, and really think about was it what you really asked for? Did it stick to the prompt? Were all of those ideas kind?

Are they inclusive?” For more resources on teaching students how to work with new technology responsibly, read Rachelle Dené Poth’s article for Edutopia, “ Guiding Students to Develop AI Literacy .”

## Transcript

Lynnea Shafter: What if we asked an AI bot that question? What might happen? Kids don’t recognize how much is AI generated in their lives. I want to give them the thinking skills to be really analytical of what they’re using. You have a responsibility when you use it to look at what it gives you and really think about is it useful? Is it safe? Is it true? What results did you get?

Katie Mittleider: STEM Lab is a special that we have in our building. It’s similar to other schools where they have their music and your PE. Everybody in our building goes at least once a week. We have a phenomenal STEM teacher. She is jumping into the AI world with them and trying to teach them those responsible boundaries within AI.

Lynnea Shafter: And that might be things like following copyright rules.

Katie Mittleider: And then she gives them a lot of hands-on learning time.

Lynnea Shafter: You need to figure out how are you going to get a chatbot to give you feedback for our prompt, and our prompt is, “What are some fun ways to say thank you to our family, friends, or community?” Instead of just doing an art project and making a thank-you card, I wanted to see if we could combine AI with that. I wanted them to keep asking the bot in different ways to see what the results would be, and then critique the results they got. If we don’t want it really broad, what are you going to add into that? As they’re working, I’m going around, and there was a lot of frustration because they weren’t getting the results I think they were expecting to get, and so I would ask them, “Are you giving it enough?” seeing if they can recognize what they’re including and what they’re leaving out, and then their results would keep regenerating. I’m hearing a few, “This isn’t what I want.” Student: Yeah.

Lynnea Shafter: We’re going to evaluate this tool. Then I introduce the concept of the rubric. To get a three, the ideas are directly related to saying thank you in fun and meaningful ways. I want you to evaluate what did it give you, and we went through the categories.

Ana: Well, some of them were creative, so I would say a 2, maybe. It wasn’t answering my question. We gave it an 8 out of 12 because it was ways to say “Thank you,” but they weren’t very good and very fun.

Lynnea Shafter: How would you score Raina? I want them to start really looking at the information they’re given and really think about, was it what you really asked for? Did it stick to the prompt? Was it creative? Were all of those ideas kind? Are they inclusive? And I think always making sure that you’re reinforcing with the students, whose work is this? Is this a tool to help me? And you really have to go back and analyze what it produces. It’s strengthening their problem-solving and thinking skills because they’re constantly having to revise their prompt to get a better result for what they want. There’s a lot of power in that.

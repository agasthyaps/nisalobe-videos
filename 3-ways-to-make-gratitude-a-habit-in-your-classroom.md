## Transcript

Narrator: According to the research, making gratitude an intentional practice in the classroom can have significant benefits. It can build resilience by helping students nurture stronger relationships, manage stress better, and regulate emotions more successfully, all key social and emotional skills that learners need to thrive in school and in life. It can even improve mental and physical health. So how can you model and teach gratitude in the classroom?

Narrator: Helping your students develop a strengths-based mindset can make for more confident and self-assured learners. Consider doing a guided meditation that prompts students to identify and appreciate their strengths through positive affirmations like naming the traits they most value in themselves. Then give learners a moment to discuss their top three strengths with a peer. Working with a partner is a safer way for shy or insecure students to appreciate their talents aloud. You can also assign a growth journal where students can reflect on their progress with prompts like, how have I grown as a learner? That encourages students to name their successes and celebrate how they’ve progressed.

Narrator: Facilitating peer gratitude promotes a classroom culture of compassion and positivity. Encourage your students to thank classmates after a partner or group activity. Verbalizing appreciation for an action, a behavior, or an attribute helps students get in the habit of expressing gratitude for others out loud. Or have students write a thank-you letter to the person of their choice. Identifying what positive behaviors look like in other people may help students to replicate it. You can also set up a gratitude jar where students can share what they admire or appreciate about other students anonymously without the pressure of having their name attached. When students need a boost, you can read a few aloud to reinforce the joy these compliments can create.

Narrator: Showing your own gratitude in the classroom through actions or words is a great way to help students visualize what expressing appreciation looks like. Try consistently noticing and thanking students aloud. It’s a simple yet effective method to reinforce positive behavior and model small acts of kindness. You can also start your morning meetings by thanking the person to your right for something they’ve done. Ask your students to follow your example. Or try writing appreciative feedback on graded assignments. Identify something you admire about their efforts right at the top. You’ll be shouting out their good work and showing what it looks like to write a supportive note. Cultivating a classroom environment that centers gratitude and appreciation, even if it feels awkward at first, just may result in students who are kinder, more encouraging, and more confident, which can help learners flourish across every grade level and beyond.

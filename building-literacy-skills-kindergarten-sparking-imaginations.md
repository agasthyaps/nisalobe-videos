## Article

In a kindergarten classroom at Pierre Elliott Trudeau Elementary School (PETES), in Gatineau, Quebec, an activity called Storyland provides teacher Heather Balson-Riosa with a rich backdrop to offer up playful natural materials and whimsical stations that will ignite creativity so that her students can build worlds—and then tell stories about them. “It’s magical to them, and they love it,” she says. Oral storytelling is a bridge to literacy, and by tapping into the vivid imaginations of young learners, teachers can encourage exploration of fundamental story elements like character, setting, and plot—and set students up for reading and writing success.

## Transcript

Student: Do one side and then the spider crawled up the house and then… Heather Riosa: Playful learning to me is seeing the joy on the children’s face when they’re learning something new. So seeing them smile, seeing them be able to use it in context when they’re playing, because they’ve learned it through play from us. When I see them giggling and laughing, but still doing what I’ve asked them to do, I say, “Yeah, that’s it. That’s great.” Storyland is oral storytelling. My students are learning the basics of writing, but they’re learning it orally, which is where they need to learn it in kindergarten. They need to learn the oral part of it because they can move into the written part as they get older. Once upon a time, tell me about your beautiful house.

Student: One day, a spider… Heather Riosa: And I cover each table with a tablecloth and it becomes that land. So, you know, the land of fall, the land of water, the land of snow, so all of those different lands. I change them up so that they’re not always the same. What we play with is nature-based. I had acorns, I have pine cones, I have shells, I have pieces of wood. I do have animals out so that they can add those in. I put out the baskets with all the nature items in it, and then they come in very quietly and they gather the items that they want to play with, and they bring it to their land of choice. And then they create whatever they’re making, the house, the trees, whatever it is. And they start telling their story, you know, to themselves, or sometimes with a partner.

Student: I think this is actually real. This is real, so we tuck down… Heather Riosa: And then I circulate and I walk around and I make sure that I touch in with every child at least once.

Student: And then this ran away and then they jump back up there… Heather Riosa: So then, as they play Storyland, I’ll go around and I’ll say, “OK, what’s the setting of your story?” and then they orally tell me what the setting is.

Student: And this is the water where he swims.

Heather Riosa: If we’re working on characters, I’ll say, “OK, who are the characters in your story?” Student: It was birds flying and some butterflies.

Heather Riosa: It was birds flying, and then their friends were butterflies? Right now, I’m trying to work on more of a beginning, middle, and end. And so when they get to grade one, if they can orally tell the story, they can hopefully start to put something down on paper. It’s magical to them and they love it, so that’s a good way for them to start their writing.

Student: I make this goat never get his chocolate peanut butter— Heather Riosa: Oh, look, and I think someone’s at the door.

Student: That’s a bear. Hello. Who’s that?

Ever wish you had a tool that allowed you to rewind and watch exactly how a student arrived at a particular thought or paragraph in their writing assignment? Every keystroke, moment of hesitation, or deletion. And when you wake up too sick to teach, what if that same tool could help build you a comprehensive skeleton for sub plans?

In this short demo, instructional technology specialist Gabriel Carrillo shows how a popular browser extension, Brisk Teaching , can help you accomplish both tasks. When a user opens Brisk Teaching’s premium Inspect Writing feature on a student’s Google Doc, the tool generates a video playback of all actions taken inside of the document—revealing a deeper look into the student’s thinking and writing process, and perhaps even helping to detect unusual copy-paste activity that might signal AI use. Users can watch sentences appear and disappear, paragraphs get reorganized, and ideas take shape in real time.

Brisk Teaching’s Sub Plan Generator, on the other hand, can transform a simple prompt or existing lesson plans into a full set of instructions for a substitute teacher. Users input important details like their learning objectives, classroom norms, school procedures, and the focus of the current unit. The platform then creates a new editable document with all necessary information and leaves fill-in-the-blank slots where additional context is needed.

Carrillo likes to add helpful classroom management notes to his initial prompt—for example, “My class can be chatty, so have them take their notes in their journal. Be sure to walk around and ensure that students are on task.” Brisk Teaching also offers tools that generate individualized student feedback, create instructional materials, and translate text into over 40 different languages. Interested in learning about other AI tools to try, but have no clue where to start?

## Transcript

Gabriel Carrillo: What’s going on, everybody? My name is Gabriel Carillo, and I’m an instructional technology specialist and consultant. Today, I’m showing you two ways to use one of my favorite time-saving tools: Brisk Teaching. Brisk Teaching provides AI-powered tools to help teachers assess student work and save time on task, like lesson planning and formative assessments across platforms like Google Workspace and Microsoft. There are tons of tools to help you with what you need for your students. We’re going to explore the Inspect writing tool, which gives you insights on how your students put their writing together and shows all edits, and the sub planning tool, a tool I use to streamline making sub plans with teachers. Let’s jump in. Before we begin, you need to make sure that you have the Brisk Teaching extension installed in either your Google Chrome browser or your Microsoft Edge browser. It works in both, so do a quick internet search and download and install the appropriate one that you need. Let’s take a look at the Inspect writing tool. First. Think of this as a behind-the-scenes look, so to speak, to get a snapshot of the student’s writing process. Open up the doc that you’d like to inspect writing, and click on the Brisk Teaching extension, and then click on Inspect writing. Brisk is creating a video playback of this Google Doc’s version history. There’s a playhead below where you can pause, rewind, and fast-forward to get an idea of the student’s thinking and workflow. There’s also a copy-and-paste button that will highlight any sections that were copied and pasted. It detected one paste, and there it’s, if I click on the detect AI writing, it gives me the likelihood of AI being a partner in the writing process, here in this case, unlikely. Remember that just because a tool states that the writing was more than likely written with the help of AI doesn’t necessarily mean that it was. This just opens up for a conversation with the student. Always use your professional judgment. Next, let’s take a look at the sub plan generator. Whether you’re out sick, attending a professional development, or just taking a well-deserved day off, you can create a full sub plan in minutes with Brisk Teaching. Let’s create a sub plan. Open your Brisk Teaching extension, and we’re going to click on Create, and we are going to scroll down until we find Sub Plan. From here, choose your grade level, how long this lesson should last, your subject area, and what you want your students to work on. In my case, we are covering culinary arts and we are covering Greek and Spanish cuisine. I have my document open with my content. I want students to learn these specific vocabulary terms as well as read the article that I’m going to have printed for them, the Mediterranean Diet, and you can also add any special instructions or anything else that the sub might need to know about your students. I put my extra notes in there, and let’s click Brisk It. You’ll see that it created a brand-new Google Doc. It is actually putting it into my Google Drive, and you can watch the magic happen. This is a fully editable doc with sub plans. Based on your input, we can now take a few minutes from the time that we saved and fine-tune those lesson plans to fit your learning intention. Hopefully this is useful. If you use Brisk Teaching or anything similar, let us know in the comments. Thanks for watching. Bye.

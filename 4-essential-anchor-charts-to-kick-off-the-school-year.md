When planning and designing a classroom environment, it’s important for teachers to be intentional about what goes on the walls. While research supports minimizing visual clutter , strategically placed anchor charts can support a positive and productive atmosphere by level-setting essential protocols early on. Anchor charts are large visual tools that can help reinforce content and routines.

In the early weeks of school, they can especially be useful in setting expectations and building community. A great place to start is by cocreating a Class Agreement chart , where students are involved in establishing shared norms to build co-ownership and accountability. Having students sign the chart can further reinforce their buy-in to the rules.

Another helpful chart that teachers can create early in the school year is an Active Listener diagram , which can also be created collaboratively with students to define the behaviors of active listening. This chart can serve as a consistent reminder of respectful, engaged communication all year long.

Teachers can also promote problem-solving and independence by displaying an “I Don’t Know What to Do” flowchart . This visual lays out clear common options for students to follow when they’re stuck or unsure how to proceed.

Posting it on the wall as a guide not only encourages critical thinking but also reduces interruptions, freeing up precious classroom time. Read more about the benefits of this chart in Michelle Hart Bram’s article for Edutopia, “ How to Establish Classroom Routines for Productive Learning .” Click the button to download a printable customizable 18×24 “I Don’t Know What to Do” poster based on Bram’s, or get a copier/printer-sized version . Smoother daily transitions can also be aided by well-planned anchor charts.

For example, an End-of-Day Routine chart helps students understand what’s expected as class wraps up. When students can reference this chart regularly, it minimizes the amount of times that teachers need to remind students of instructions.

Anchor charts aren’t just for the beginning of the year—they can be updated and rotated to support new content and evolving classroom needs. By using visual references thoughtfully, educators can help students internalize routines, stay focused, and develop autonomy. In the long run, intentionally chosen and placed anchor charts contribute to a well-managed, student-centered classroom that supports both academic growth and positive behavior.

## Transcript

Narrator: When deciding what to put on your classroom walls, it can be hard to determine what will be most impactful, both for your class culture and the learning outcomes of your students. While research shows that there are benefits to keeping walls free of clutter, a few intentionally placed anchor charts can be an effective tool. Anchor charts are poster-sized visual references that often help scaffold content instruction, but they can also establish structure, routines and class expectations, especially in the first few weeks of school. One essential anchor chart to begin with is a co-created classroom agreements contract. Establish a set of shared norms together to invite ownership and accountability from your students, and then display them. Make it a collaborative activity that sets the tone for the entire year. You can have each student sign the agreement for extra buy-in. Another helpful visual to make and reference as a class is a good listener diagram. Ask your students to share the signs of active listening and fill in a set of descriptors that can act as a consistent reminder and model of appropriate engaged behavior. To set the stage for a culture of independent thinking, you can post and go over an “I don’t know what to do” flow chart with displayed options that help students get unstuck when faced with common questions. Pointing students to the chart later will encourage them to find solutions on their own, saving you a lot of time. To avoid explaining basic class procedures and transitions each day, you can also put up posters that reference helpful daily routines, such as an end-of-day routine to outline what is expected of students at the end of each class. Anchor charts are versatile and they can be used and rotated throughout the year to visually support classroom procedures and help academic lessons stick. The mindful use of visual references will not only benefit your students’ ability to solve problems within your classroom, it can help lay foundational groundwork and aid in classroom management.

# Connecting Science to Problem-Solving in the Real World

> Tackling authentic problems in science helps students see the link between the lab and the challenges facing our world—and builds skills.

## Article

At Barbara Morgan STEM Academy , an elementary school in Meridian, Idaho, students approach nearly every subject through a STEM lens. As fifth-grade teacher Jamie Schildknecht explains, “So many of the problems in the world—and [the ones] that we’re going to solve in the future—are going to be solved through scientific thinking. Even if the students are not becoming scientists, those ideas of collaboration, critical thinking, and communication are going to tie into anything they end up doing.” This perspective is particularly powerful for elementary students, whose natural curiosity drives them to learn about the world around them.

Teachers at Barbara Morgan harness this curiosity and create meaningful projects for the students by pulling in real-world science challenges. In Schildknecht’s class, students make a direct connection between their lab and an environmental disaster: the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . After learning about the devastating impact, students are tasked with working in small groups to design and test their own cleanup strategies.

Aluminum trays become miniature oceans, with cotton feathers standing in for birds and pipe cleaners representing sea mammals. Equipped with a selection of everyday materials like sponges, spoons, baking soda, and cotton balls, the young scientists dive into the challenge with inquisitive focus. Guided by Schildknecht’s questions and encouragement, students plan, test, and adjust their strategies as they go.

They compare results across groups, talk through what worked and what didn’t, and reflect on how they might improve their approach next time. The activity feels playful, but it’s also deeply purposeful: Students are practicing how to think like scientists while building essential habits for problem-solving and teamwork. For principal Katie Mittleider, the value of these moments is clear.

“It’s powerful to see kids connect what’s happening in the world with what they’re learning,” she says. “They begin to see that they can make a difference.” By approaching real-world challenges through hands-on inquiry, Barbara Morgan STEM Academy helps students see that their ideas matter—and that they already have the tools to take on complex problems.

## Transcript

Jamie Schildknecht: Think about the environmental impact of using a lot of that over all of that coastline. So many of the problems in the world that we’re going to solve in the future are going to be solved through scientific thinking. And so even if they’re not becoming scientists, that those ideas of collaboration, critical thinking, communication, it’s going to tie into anything that they end up doing.

Student: I can see the spots where it’s collected the oil.

Student: Yeah.

Student: The absorbance works well, but it’s only like a onetime use.

Katie Mittleider: We are a STEM school, so we have the opportunity to embed STEM into everything that we do. It’s super-powerful, because you look at kids and they’re so curious about the world around them, and the STEM lens allows them to experience things and do hands-on learning. And it’s not all on the computer and it’s not all from a book or up on the whiteboard. They really get to get into it.

Jamie Schildknecht: We’re going to define the problem, talk about the constraints, and brainstorm some solutions. And then… So we’re looking at real-world problems that often are scientific in nature, and as we’re designing solutions and fixing things, focusing on that thinking to make the world a better place. You’ll see the scientists talking about the event. So this morning we watched a short video about the Deepwater Horizon spill, and then we started in on the oil spill test. So the idea was to see how much oil you could contain and recover from the spill, both in the ocean and then cleaning up the wildlife and the shore. You will be attempting to use these items, six of them, to contain the oil, try to keep it from spreading to try to clean up the water, shoreline, wildlife as best you can. So before they were able to start testing, they had to not just come up with a plan, but write it down and be specific.

Student: I feel like the brown paper bag would really work, and probably the coffee filter.

Jamie Schildknecht: I think that helps focus their work so that they’re not just willy-nilly doing all this. Once you have your six materials to test, bring your data sheet up and tell me what you need. For their initial tests, they just had a single rock in one tub, a feather to represent a bird and the pipe cleaner to represent sea animal. And then the other tub was just plain water.

Student: What are you saying the containment?

Student: Containment… Poor?

Student: Poor.

Student: Very poor.

Jamie Schildknecht: And then based on those results in the discussion, they chose three final ones.

Student: We’re going to use the baking soda on the rocks because if it’s in the water, we can’t clean it up, but if it’s on the rocks, it’ll probably be easier to clean up.

Jamie Schildknecht: For the final test, they had a full-on baking tray with some rocks and gravel to represent the shoreline.

Student: We should put the dish soap in the sponge.

Student: But we need something that will scoop it up.

Jamie Schildknecht: They added the oil into it.

Student: It’s stopping the oil from getting to it.

Student: Yeah.

Jamie Schildknecht: They ran the test and then we had a discussion afterwards. What was effective, what wasn’t effective.

Student: The sponge and the cotton swabs we used, because a sponge is absorbent, it’s a little hard to get it off, but once you do, it’s really good.

Katie Mittleider: Students get to take what is happening in the world, and they really get to apply their learning to that. It helps them walk through that process of how can they effect change.

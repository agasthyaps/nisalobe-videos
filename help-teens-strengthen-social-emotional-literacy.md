While much energy is invested in helping young children begin to identify and articulate their emotions, regulate themselves, and learn social skills, that focus tends to taper off as students get older. But social and emotional skills are just as critical in middle and high school, as students learn how to navigate more complex situations and relationships, confront higher expectations that bring more anxiety and stress, and grapple with bullying and social pressures. From gratitude journaling to mindfulness exercises, encouraging positive inner voice to connecting SEL to curriculum, these four strategies will make space for teens to keep building the lifelong skills that will help them throughout school and beyond.

## Transcript

Narrator: Social and emotional learning is often a priority in elementary school, but the resources tend to taper off as students get older, due to crammed class schedules and academic load. But research shows that teenagers still need lots of SEL support as they learn to navigate complex responsibilities and manage higher expectations, social pressures, and stress. Here are four ways you can make space to build much-needed social and emotional literacy and self-regulation practices in your middle or high school classroom. Giving students frequent opportunities to identify and vocalize how they feel is key to building emotional awareness and connection in the classroom. In the first few minutes after the bell, have your students slow down, take stock of their emotional state, and write three things in a journal that they are grateful for. Afterward, ask them to choose one and share with the class. You can also simply have each student say one word that describes how they’re doing at that moment. These short exercises increase students’ self-awareness and establish emotional resonance in the class before they dive into the academic work. Much of teens’ emotional well-being can be driven by how they see themselves. Their inner voice has the potential to be incredibly impactful—both in and out of school. Ask each student to complete a strength survey to identify what they excel at. Then, have them write a few simple affirmations they can use to reflect on and tap into those strengths. Though it may feel awkward or silly at first, regularly repeating statements that boost confidence in self-esteem, such as “I am capable. I am a strong collaborator. I can succeed” can have a dramatic effect on students’ moods, achievement, and belief in themselves. Creating space for mindfulness through breathing exercises and visualizations can improve students’ working memory and reduce anxiety. At a natural break in class, tell your students to close their eyes and focus on their breath for a few moments. Have them imagine what stress looks like and feels like inside their body, and then ask them to release it. This visualization allows teens to recenter, let go of stressors, then refocus on the task at hand—in just a few minutes. Finding ways to integrate SEL into your academic content can be an impactful way to grow emotional literacy in tandem with what students are learning in class. Assign novels with themes relevant to teenagers’ lives to help students develop compassion and empathy for others, or use characters and events from history to build their social understanding and add context around current events. Have students meet regularly in small reflection groups for open discussions about the topics and themes they relate to the most, to practice their interpersonal skills and ability to navigate sensitive topics. Providing ways for teens to grow their social skills and build their emotional literacy will not only help them succeed in your class, but in all areas of life.

## Article

November 6, 2008: Small World: How to Bring Your Students into the Global Classroom Host: Grace Rubenstein, senior producer, Edutopia Presenter: Blogger and author Will Richardson, a member of Edutopia ‘s National Advisory Council Description: Unlike books, radio, and other media, the Internet is a two-way communication tool. Online, everyday people are able to shape and contribute to the collective experience — it empowers you and your students to become information producers, rather than mere consumers. We know that the Web is changing politics, business, and the media, but what does that mean for teachers and schools?

That’s what we’ll be talking about during the webinar.

## Article

Middle school teacher Cathleen Beachboard gives homework to her students’ families a few weeks before school starts—she asks them to describe their child in a million words or less. The information she gets back allows her to get a jump start on forming relationships with her students that will help them bring their best to the classroom throughout the school year. Beachboard has made an editable version of the Million Words handout available for other educators to use (requires Google sign-in to make a copy).

The Million Words activity originated with teacher Deb Bova on the MiddleWeb site in 2003 but has endless variations.

## Transcript

Cathleen Beachboard: “In a Million Words or Less” is a simple practice that I often refer to as homework for parents. I send it to the parents and guardians through email and the mail two weeks before the first week of school to utilize their expertise on what they know best, which is their child. The parent, ultimately, they’re your partner. They’re an asset to the classroom. Oftentimes we go to parents in response to something, but this allows you to be proactive. It creates a two-way communication street from day one to help the child thrive. This is an activity that gets one of the greatest response rates, because who does not like to talk about their kids? I get all kinds of information, how to pronounce their name correctly, strengths the child has, or challenges that the child has faced. They might talk about the child’s likes and what they’re into, their dislikes, as well as those pro tips that they know from raising that kid on how to motivate them. I use this information in my class to form relationships with the kids. So the moment the child comes to the door you can say, “Hey John, I heard you like trains.” Or, “Jessica, you’re really into TikTok right now!” I can use what they like in my lessons, ensuring that they’ll be more engaged. And I can purposely put kids together or in groups where they have a common interest. Those simple things allow the child to open up and bloom in the classroom right away.

## Transcript

Teacher: Okay, good morning, everybody. Every day, students come in and they grab what’s called a do now sheet. It’s a small, warm-up activity. I ask them to state the objective for that lesson in their own words, and identify a strategy that’s going to help them finish. Okay, I’m ready for any do nows if you have them for me. All right, what have we got? This gives me an opportunity to check in with each student, each day, so we have some face time. What lesson are you on? How are you going to get on pace? Is there anything you need from me? And then let’s chat about that Berlin question you had, okay? So I’m going to do those guys at the table first and then we’ll talk, okay? Hey, Moni, what have we got going on today? I do a quick social emotional check to ask them how they’re feeling. I’m sorry you’re stormy. You okay? All right. It gives them a chance to just have a check in period that’s guaranteed every day. How much more time do you think you need to finish six nine?

Student: Ten more minutes.

Teacher: Okay, good, I like that plan.

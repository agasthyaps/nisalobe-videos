In many high schools, only the top few highest-performing students get the chance to give a speech sharing a reflection on their school journey. But at Casco Bay High School, in Portland, Maine, every graduating senior experiences this opportunity. Through a series of introspective writing exercises, students craft a speech to deliver to an audience of classmates, family, and the greater school community that helps them make meaning of their four years of high school and look to the future with confidence.

The result is a powerful, joyful event—and an established rite of passage that the school’s younger students look forward to. Says high school senior Kaya, “Now that it’s done and I performed it, [I know] I wouldn’t have been able to be successful without being pushed. It’s the genuine care and love that the teachers have because they want you to succeed.

They know your greatness and potential.” English language arts teacher Susan McCray, who supports and guides the students as they write their “final word” narratives, believes the experience is transformative for the students. “Every single kid is heard,” she says. “And cherished, in that moment.

Right? Loved, in that moment. Because that’s what happens up there.” To learn more about the research behind the practices seen in the video, check out the links below.

## Transcript

Student: I ask myself, why should I grow? I ask myself, did I really live? Susan McCray: Too often, education is about fill out that worksheet so that you can get it in, so the teacher can say, yes, you’re done with it, so you can move on to the next worksheet.

Student: I want to do something splendid before I go into my castle. Susan McCray: We need to build our skills, but we work really hard to ensure that the skill building even is in the context of that thing that’s going to matter.

Student: I think I shall write books. That would suit me. So that is my favorite dream. Susan McCray: Final Word is a ritual that we designed for our seniors, where they craft a piece of writing that they are going to deliver to the class and the larger community. So it ends with every single student having a moment behind the podium. Their families are invited, friends are invited, and they get their moment in the spotlight. They get their moment that is theirs, where we listen to them and we honor them.

Kaya: I’m proud to say I have no fear for change, for I know I’ve become a more adaptable being that is ready to just let the water flow over me. Susan McCray: So they prepare and they write a piece that is about three minutes long that is guided by some questions. One being, how do you want to be in the world going forward? This is our last class before Final Word.

Kaya: She set us up with, like, lots of specific questions like: What are hardships that you had in your life? Who were the important characters in your life? Susan McCray: And they don’t always answer all of those. Sometimes one speaks to them, right? But it gives them a sense of what they’re trying to do. A lot of groundwork is done before I even say the word Final Word in the classroom. We do a couple of fun things. We do a little walk down memory lane. We do a six-word memoir as a way to get them starting to think about, what’s your story? Susan McCray: And then it’s time to get writing.

Lionel: We had first started off with, like, ideas and themes or big events that we would like to share, and then as we kept writing these ideas, we developed them into drafts. Susan McCray: Have you moved from poem to narrative?

Student: Yeah, I’m trying. Susan McCray: The first draft, you just have to get something down.

Kaya: Growth within the friend group. It was hard for me to pick what I wanted to write about. What was vulnerable enough that I felt like I was going to grow from that sharing, but not like compromising my own feelings. So I had to find a balance. Susan McCray: Second-draft work is to figure out the stories you want to tell. Third draft is we need to go in and polish it up. So at that stage, then it’s really about conferencing. It’s about feedback. Well, what do you want? What do you think it needs?

Lionel: Through the writing and accepting all this feedback from the teachers, you definitely feel an accomplishment when you get the work done. I was so determined to find my spark again. Things took a turn when I diagnosed myself with a case of senioritis. I was hardly doing any work or going to classes. Sorry, Mom. Susan McCray: I’ve seen the kids’ eyes wide when they recognize what they’re capable of and they had no idea before. They just did something they had never done before. There’s nothing better, and Final Word does that.

Kaya: I felt inspired by all the strong women in my life, and even when I faced challenges, I gained strength knowing I was becoming more like them. Like now that it’s done and I performed it, I’m like, I wouldn’t have been able to be successful in that without being pushed. It’s the genuine care and love that the teachers have because they want you to succeed, and they know your greatness and potential.

Lionel: I hope that as every day goes by, I’ll keep improving as a human being, spreading kindness and paving my own way when there isn’t a way. Thank you. Today I felt a sense of relief and content with myself and definitely some pride. Now I’m really proud of myself. It was just an amazing feeling—we felt this unity and togetherness today. Susan McCray: That is joyful and that’s why this event is so emotional and moving. Every single kid has that opportunity to figure this out, and then every single kid is heard and cherished in that moment, right? Loved in that moment, because that’s what happens up there.

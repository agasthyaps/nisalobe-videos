## Article

At the beginning of the year, setting expectations around proper use of classroom materials is essential. Demonstrations of how to use and care for various items can help empower students to be responsible and knowledgeable school community members. But instead of a dry lecture on the rules, at The Co-op School in Brooklyn, New York, preschool teacher Eddie Laguna uses an engaging game called Silly Shop to keep his students on track when it comes to using objects in the intended way.

To play, Laguna pretends he is the shop owner. Prior to the start of the game, he has pulled a few items to the side. The items are things he wants students to know how to use correctly.

A student comes into the store and chooses an item, and when Laguna is checking them out at the register, he pretends that he knows how the item works. The catch? He comes up with a giggle-inducing ridiculous use instead of the real one.

For example, he pretends a floor sweeper is a giant toothbrush, or a glue stick is a deodorant. Students then jump in to demonstrate the correct use of the item. “I just really like the fact that the kids become teachers,” says Laguna.

“I get to take that teacher hat off for a second and just be a silly, goofy person. They respond really well to that.” And since Laguna is a pre-K teacher, it also serves as a great way to get students to practice using their words to articulate their thoughts. Silly Shop can also be an effective teaching tool for later in the year, to remind the students what to do when a classroom tool or material is not used properly.

“If they’re ever using items in an inappropriate way or a way that they’re not normally supposed to be used, we can kind of take that and revisit it in a fun way,” Laguna explains. “It’s really nice to see them so excited, and it really helps our classroom management.” For more information about Silly Shop and two other games that allow young learners to use their imaginations while reinforcing classroom norms and concepts, read Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene ’s article for Edutopia, “ 3 Improv Exercises to Use as Guided Play .”

## Transcript

Eddie Laguna: All right. Friends, we’re going to play Silly Shop. Ready? Three, two, one. Because we play Silly Shop, my students see me in a very silly and ridiculous way and also get to learn about how to use their words to describe how items are being used in the classroom. Good morning, I’m the Silly Shop owner. Welcome to my store. When we’re trying to work with kids, we’re trying to find ways that are fun to teach them. What can I get for you? Yes, yes, yes. Silly Shop is a great way to teach them uses of these items. The way that we did Silly Shop was that one person comes up at a time, and I keep trying to come up with a new use of this item. Wait a second. I remember. It was to brush my hair. That’s right. This is what I use in the morning to brush my hair. Yes?

Student: No.

Eddie Laguna: And then they say, “No, no, no. This is what this item is for.” What is this?

Student: It’s a brush.

Eddie Laguna: It’s a brush for the floor? I just really like the fact that the kids become teachers. I get to take that teacher hat off for a second, just be a silly, goofy person. They respond really well to that. This is when I’m getting ready to go out and I take it off and I put it under my underarms like this. I try to rotate whatever items are that are common items I know that they know what the purpose is for so that they can help in a detailed way, reiterate what it is. What are you doing?

Student: Gluing.

Eddie Laguna: Gluing? How are you doing that? I tried with one of the students to really break down what she was doing, and I was trying to have her describe, just to take it step-by-step so that they are working on just vocabulary, description, and details about what it is that they’re doing. What does the glue do to the paper?

Student: Sticks.

Eddie Laguna: Oh, it makes it sticky. Of course. Wait a second. I just realized I have one more item, and it is the biggest bagel with cream cheese that you’ve ever seen. If they’re ever using items in an inappropriate way or a way that they’re not normally supposed to be used, we can take that and revisit it in a fun way. It’s not a bagel with cream cheese? Oh, my goodness. There was a time where they were all trying to get into the tube at the same time. It was getting really crowded in there and nobody could move through, so that gave us the opportunity to say, “OK, stop. Hold on. You’re not all able to go through it at the same time. It’s not safe. What should we do here?” What happens when you put too many things in the tube?

Student: It blocks things.

Eddie Laguna: It blocks things. It clogs the pipes. So how do we use the tube? How many people should go in the tube?

Student: One.

Eddie Laguna: One person at a time. So that makes them stop and critically think, “OK, we know that we have to go in one at a time to not clog up the tube.” See how much easier it is when we’re going one person at a time? The more fun and approachable lessons are and teaching is, the more response and engagement you’re going to get from students no matter what their age is. It’s really nice to see them so excited, and it really helps their classroom management.

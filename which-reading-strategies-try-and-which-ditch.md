Narrator: It’s not uncommon for long-established literacy practices to stick around in classrooms, even when research shows they’re no longer the best way to develop skilled readers. For example, while reading logs may seem like a simple way to keep tabs on students’ reading, research shows they tend to chip away at their interest and pleasure in reading. Popular turn-taking practices, like round robin and popcorn reading, meanwhile, tend to stigmatize poor readers, weaken comprehension, and sabotage fluency and pronunciation. And when schools offer prizes for reading, like gaming tokens or badges, it can backfire, ultimately reducing reading motivation. Finally, when we overemphasize teaching reading as a discrete skill, we shortchange the value of background knowledge and leave young readers without the vocabulary, or the context, to make sense of passages. The good news? You can support background knowledge, and build intrinsic motivation and reading fluency, with these strategies. According to a 2011 study, whole class choral reading helps students improve phonological decoding and boosts oral reading fluency skills. It also lowers the stakes for struggling readers and extends the length of passages all kids are exposed to. Pair kids up with peers for a 10-minute chat about their reading. Via a mini-lesson, explain how students can hold peers accountable and deliver and receive quality feedback. Designate a special spot for students to write inspiring quotes from books they’re reading. Start by explaining the standards for a great quote, and model how to find one during teacher read-alouds. Once they’ve got the hang of it, ask students to find their own quotes for the graffiti wall for discussion. Silent independent reading is an important stage of development. But before sending kids off with a book, lay a solid foundation by scaffolding the activity for them. Consider pre-teaching vocabulary, providing a plot overview, and maybe introducing a K-W-L activity. It’s tough to find time for read-alouds, but teachers tell us it’s a valuable practice with powerful benefits right up through high school. Try setting aside five to seven minutes to model reading strategies, stopping often to wonder out loud and showing kids what good readers do when they don’t know a word or understand a plot twist.

In many circumstances, artificial intelligence (AI) can be a tremendously poor teacher—immediately giving away answers and hindering students’ abilities to think for themselves. But two 2024 studies both show that well-designed AI chatbots—customized with clear prompts to act like tutors and ask probing questions that interrogate students’ understanding of the material—can actually be great learning aids. MagicSchool AI is a popular platform that offers a range of free instructional tools; one such tool is the “Custom Chatbot” feature.

In this short demo, Edutopia’s assistant editor Daniel Leonard shows how teachers can access this Custom Chatbot tool, customize a bot based on the needs of their particular class, and then create a “Room” that houses the chatbot, which their students can join. Leonard also shows what students see when they enter the room and begin to interact with the chatbot. To learn more about the research cited in the video, check out the links below.

Hamsa Bastani et al.’s study on how base AI models can hinder learning, but models designed to act as tutors can boost learning (2024) Gregory Kestin et al.’s study on how an AI tutor model was able to help Harvard undergraduate students learn more physics in less time (2024) Here is the sample prompt that Leonard references in the video, which teachers can use as inspiration when customizing their own chatbots: You are a tutor for the fifth-grade science students in Mrs. Smith’s class. Like a good tutor, you help students come to the right conclusions ON THEIR OWN by asking them probing questions; you NEVER provide them the answer directly.

Keep responses brief—no more than 100 words. Today’s topic is photosynthesis. Through probing questions, help Mrs.

Smith’s students come to a complete and accurate understanding of photosynthesis that answers the following questions: —Why are leaves green? —What do plants convert light energy into? —What role does photosynthesis play in sustaining all life on Earth, not just plant life? Begin each chat with the question “What do you already know about photosynthesis?” and let the conversation flow from there. For more detail about the research-backed benefits of customized AI tutors, read Leonard’s feature article for Edutopia titled, “ AI Tutors Can Work—With the Right Guardrails .”

## Transcript

Daniel Leonard: Hi everyone, my name is Daniel and I’m an assistant editor at Edutopia. And in this video I wanted to talk about creating AI tutors. Now, as you probably know, AI can definitely hinder student learning. If a student turns to ChatGPT, for example, to discuss their math or English or science homework, then ChatGPT is generally just going to give them the answer outright, which is obviously not useful to their learning. But two 2024 studies, one out of Harvard and one out of the University of Pennsylvania, have found that interacting with AI chatbots actually can benefit student learning if those bots are specifically designed not to give away the answers, but rather to ask students probing questions. So in this video, I wanted to show how you can create an AI tutor like this so that after a lesson your students have somewhere to review the material. And for this, we’re going to be using the free platform MagicSchool AI. So after signing up for a free MagicSchool account, we’ll go to Magic Student and hit “Create New Room.” And then we’ll be asked to customize the room a bit. We can give it a name. For grade level, let’s say “fifth grade” and max number of students. And then on this step we can add tools to the room. For this we just need one, the custom chatbot tool. So I’ll hit “Add” and then “Next.” And then on this app, we can customize our chatbot, give it a name, a description, but most importantly, we can give it a set of instructions that it will carry over across all future interactions. So I’ll paste in a prompt that I refined after interacting with the bot a little bit and we’ll include this below so that you can copy and paste it and refine it to your own needs. It asks the bot to do a few things. Most importantly, in accordance with the research, it tells it not to give away the answer directly, but rather help students come to their own conclusions. And I’ve also found it helpful to tell the bot to begin each chat with the same question just to standardize interactions a bit. We’ll toggle this to “Hidden,” and that prevents students from changing the prompt later on. And one more thing you can do is give the bot some additional background knowledge. Now, I assume it already knows what photosynthesis is, but just to give it a better sense for the sorts of things students might need to know about photosynthesis, I downloaded some grade-level relevant resources from the Encyclopedia Britannica and National Geographic that I’ll provide it with. And then we’ll hit “Next” and “Save”. And finally the “Launch Room.” And five to 10 seconds later we now have a URL that we can send to students so they can join our room. So let’s see what it looks like from their end. So following that link, a student will be asked to type in their name and hit “Join.” They don’t even need to create an account or anything. And once they’ve acknowledged, now they can find the chatbot that their teacher created. So if we click that and hit “Generate,” let’s see what we see as our student here. It takes a bit to load the first time, but about 10 seconds later here, we now have that question that we asked it to give. “What do you already know about photosynthesis?” So as a student, I’ll say something like, “I think photosynthesis is how plants turn sunlight into glucose.” And let’s see what it says in response. And again, this bot is a bit slower than some other chatbots out there, but it is entirely free to use. “That’s a great start. You’re right that photosynthesis involves converting sunlight into glucose, but let’s build on that knowledge. Can you think about what other ingredients a plant might need? Here’s a hint, from the air and soil.” So yeah, a student can continue to have interactions with this bot and build their understanding of the class material, and it will continue to ask questions rather than give answers. So hopefully this was a helpful tutorial for how to create a bot like this so that your students have somewhere to rehearse the class material on their own time. And if you happen to use a tool like this already, definitely let us know in the comments. We’d love to hear from you. All right, thanks so much for watching. Bye.

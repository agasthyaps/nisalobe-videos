## Transcript

Linda: What we choose to learn and put our effort toward depends on what we think we ourselves are capable of doing. And when we have the opportunity to learn from role models who are from our community and we can see ourselves in them, that provides a motivation to say, yes, I too could do that. I too could learn that thing or do that thing.

Leader: And then we’re going to read our sight words. We have one, two, three… Bridget: Wings works hard to recruit Wings leaders who have similar demographics to the kids that we serve.

Leader: Whoever gets this one, they’re the champ.

Bridget: So our Wings leaders are usually enrolled in college and they are coming straight from class. So they talk about things like, “I’m getting ready for my exams.” I think that’s really important, because the kids can then strive to see somebody that looks like them, and may have a very similar background and say, you know, “I can do that too.” Karen: It really is important for adults to maximize the points of connection between themselves and the young person. Because basically, what research tells us is, the more I understand that you’re like me, the more I understand that I can do what you’re asking me to do.

London: I went to Wings in elementary school.

Keyasia: I can remember her distinctly, her stomping. So we would know that it’s London and she probably got in trouble, or she’s upset with something.

London: I would show my emotions in a bad way, but Wings helped me show them in a good way. Miss Mallory, I could talk to her about anything. And if I was having a bad day, she could make me have a better day. After I graduated high school, Miss Mallory told me that there was a position open for me. At first, I wanted to do it, but then again, I didn’t know like, if I was capable of doing it.

Keyasia: The first thing she said, she’s like, “I don’t know if I can do this. What if the kids are like me?” and I was like, “Well, that’s perfect. That’s all the reason more why you should do it.” She’s able to step into Wings kids’ shoes and see exactly what they’re going through, and she can recall methods that Wings leaders use in order to get her back on track.

London: It’s okay, we can work on it. Wherever you’re not good at, we can work on it.

Linda: There’s some fascinating research which shows that the number of commonalities we know about each other, develops our relationship and our capacity to teach and learn.

Karen: If you are someone who doesn’t even start with the visible connections, I’m not your race, I’m not your gender, I’m not from your neighborhood, I’m not from your social economic class, you know, it doesn’t look like we have a whole lot in common. But we probably have some things in common. Talk to me a little bit about your life, what you like, et cetera. You’re looking for seeds to build on, and if they’re not obvious, we still have the responsibility to find them.

London: Everything that I went through and learned as a Wings kid, I’m just here to help other kids.

Keyasia: So I’m proud of her, who she’s become and I think Wings had a big part to do with that, I must say.

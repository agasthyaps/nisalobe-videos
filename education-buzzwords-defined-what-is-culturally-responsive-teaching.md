## Transcript

Sarah Bartels Marrero: Our student community is made up of all types of learners. Culturally responsive teaching is capitalizing on all that students bring into the classroom from their personal lives and their home lives. And respecting that and using that to create classrooms that are powerful and meaningful.

Karina Sanchez: You need to know who your students are, their backgrounds, their interests, their families. And using that is going to be your number one tool in driving your instruction. That’s how you make it relevant to them. That’s how you make it exciting for them—because they see themselves in the text, they see themselves in the examples.

Antonio Gomez: My cultural heritage was largely absent from my school experience. And I don’t want students to go through that. I want them to be able to explore the richness of their identity and the identity of their neighbors.

Teacher: This made Grace sad for two reasons. She didn’t like Natalie, and she didn’t have a daddy of her own. She couldn’t imagine.

Teacher: Thanks a lot for that, Carlos. That means a lot.

Teacher: Why don’t, John Carlo, why don’t you come up first?

John: I would like to dedicate this class to my grandfather. He’s an immigrant and he knew very little English.

Marrero: Any school should and can know who their students are and what they bring in the classroom with them and use that to strengthen their teaching and their support of those students.

In teacher Katie Giordano’s classroom, fourth graders can’t wait to play Love It/Hate It, a popular improv game for character analysis that helps students practice perspective-taking and hone skills for persuasive writing. Giordano teaches at a public pre-K through 8 school called Arts & Letters 305 United in Brooklyn, where theater and improvisation activities have a role to play in every classroom. Through a collaboration with a local arts organization, Child’s Play NY , teachers there have learned to use these games to bring more joy, connection, and movement into their lessons, which serves to deepen the students’ understanding of core content—while they sharpen their executive function skills and build classroom community.

When Love It/Hate It is an English language arts activity, one student is designated as the actor and stands in front of the room, ready to portray a literary character from a book that the class has been reading (in this case, Front Desk , by Kelly Yang). Another student, sitting in the audience, is the “emotion conductor.” Using hand signals, the emotion conductor leans toward “love it” or “hate it,” and the actor improvises a monologue, toggling between those two emotions—while in character. The actor must analyze the book’s main character, Mia, on the fly, by describing her challenges, triumphs, and problem-solving abilities—engaging in making inferences and recalling text details in the process.

Beyond English language arts, Giordano has also used the game in her science lessons. “We’ve been learning about our New York City watershed and the human impact. And so they can easily be an expert and go from what they love about how amazing our watershed is and how it all works, to what they hate about the human impact on it,” she says.

By connecting Love It/Hate It to academic content, Giordano says, “I can assess what they have understood and taken away from different lessons.” Giordano takes care to point to the importance of creating a supportive classroom environment where students feel comfortable and encouraged to participate, be vulnerable, and take risks. “I think kids are very compassionate to begin with, but they really need to have that cultivated in the classroom,” she says. “If someone’s feeling nervous, we send them some ‘shine’ to get up onstage.

We always applaud someone, and I say, ‘Wow, that took a lot of courage and bravery. Let’s give them a celebration.’ And then the kids naturally start to do that on their own, and then I can take a step back and even have kids lead each other in these activities.” For more theater games that support learning, check out the many articles that Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene has written for Edutopia.

## Transcript

Katie Giordano: OK, why don’t we give her a lights, camera, action. Ready?

Students: Lights, camera, action.

Julie: You know, working at the front desk is like neutral, kind of boring, but at the same time, I love it so much because you could just buzz people in.

Giordano: Theater games really touch on so many different skills. You’re using a lot of executive functioning skills. You are getting kids to work together and collaborate. And then independently, kids are getting up and they’re taking risks and being brave. And as an audience, the whole community is supporting one another.

Julie: He gave me a saltine cracker burger that was delish.

Giordano: Amazing, give Julie a round of applause. The game Love It/Hate It is one of our favorites in the classroom. We’ve been using it a lot lately for persuasive writing and seeing different perspectives.

Students: Love it, hate it.

Giordano: Today, we use Love It/Hate It for an ELA connection with our novel study; we’re reading Front Desk, by Kelly Yang. Mia’s our main character. What are some of the jobs Mia does at a front desk?

Student: She controls the money and the keys.

Giordano: Kids are really thinking about this character and what has shaped her through all of these different experiences.

Student: If there’s a problem, she can always fix it.

Giordano: She’s such a problem solver. So to play this game, you start with one student getting up on stage and transition between those two feelings of loving something and hating something. And then you have another student who’s the emotion conductor. Do you want to be the emotion conductor again? And so they’re sort of swinging the baton to Love It side and Hate It side, and that student has to go in a moment from one of those feelings to the next.

Student: I buzzed in the wrong guy. He grabbed me up on the shirt, but then again, it’s so fun.

Giordano: It is tapping into skills like character analysis, making inferences, recalling details from the text. So there’s so many academic skills that I’m seeing. And then when they go to have their own discussions and write about it, I feel like they get to know that character a lot more through having these theater experiences where they’re acting on the character’s emotions. Kids are very compassionate to begin with, but they really need to have that cultivated in the classroom. So we do little things. If someone’s feeling nervous, we say send them some shine to get up onstage. We always applaud someone. I am really thoughtful about the language I use. And I say, “Wow, that took a lot of courage and bravery. Let’s give them a celebration.” And then the kids naturally start to do that on their own.

Students: Good job!

Giordano: It’s really become a part of who we are in our classroom, building a safe space where kids can get up and feel comfortable doing this and being vulnerable—they know they’re going to be supported.

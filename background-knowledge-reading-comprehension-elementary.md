# Why Prior Knowledge Wins the Game

> Although schools have been prioritizing discrete skills in reading instruction for years, education writer Natalie Wexler says building rich background knowledge could lead to more successful readers.

## Article

Are we doing elementary students a disservice by focusing on skills and strategies over background knowledge when we teach reading? Natalie Wexler shares a study that gives evidence that prior knowledge is more important than general skill in reading comprehension, and she makes the case that this is one of the roots of the achievement gap. Read more of Wexler’s ideas about how to build better readers in Andrew Boryga’s interview for Edutopia, “ Rethinking How We Teach Reading in Elementary School .” To see the baseball study referenced in the video, look up Recht and Leslie’s 1988 research paper, “ Effect of Prior Knowledge on Good and Poor Readers’ Memory of Text .”

## Transcript

Natalie Wexler: This idea that skills and strategies are more important than building kids’ substantive knowledge in the elementary years, the assumption has been that this is the way to boost scores on reading tests, and so what you’ve got is a real marginalization of anything but reading and math from the curriculum. But if you look at what cognitive scientists know about how reading comprehension works, what’s really crucial is how much relevant knowledge the reader has to the text. So it’s not that you can never ask a student, “What’s the main idea of this passage?” Or, “Can you make an inference?” It’s a question of what’s put in the foreground. There was a famous study called “The Baseball Study,” which took a bunch of seventh and eighth graders, and the idea was to see what is more important to reading comprehension—is it general skill or is it knowledge of the topic? They divided these kids into four groups, depending on how well they had done on a standardized reading comprehension test and how much they knew about baseball. They gave them a passage to read about baseball and tested their comprehension of that passage, and they discovered that what really made the difference was knowledge of baseball. And even the “poor readers” who knew a lot about baseball scored significantly better than the “good readers” who did not know about baseball. So knowledge is like Velcro. Kids who start out with more knowledge and vocabulary are in a better position to then absorb and retain even more knowledge and vocabulary because they have a context. They have that other half of the Velcro. And that enables them in turn to read more complex texts. But the other kids are falling farther and farther behind every year. They’re reading simpler texts, and they’re also less likely to be able to retain it, because they don’t have that other half of the Velcro. So what happens is that these gaps grow larger as time goes by. Kids get to high school, and suddenly they’re expected to read a textbook on world history, and they just don’t have the background knowledge. And it’s not that they can’t learn those things. It’s that they have never been taught those things in a way that’s likely to stick. And it puts them at a tremendous disadvantage. So if you can start narrowing that gap earlier, if you start building knowledge in elementary school, you’re going to get a lot more bang for your buck.

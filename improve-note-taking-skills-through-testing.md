# How Testing Students Twice Can Improve Note-Taking Skills

> Allowing students to take a test two times—once from memory and once using their notes—can boost note-taking, study skills, and reading habits, all at once.

Years into his career as a high school government and history teacher, Benjamin Barbour discovered he’d been making assumptions about his students. Like many teachers, Barbour would instruct students to take notes, without assessing if they knew how. Promoting good note-taking skills has since become one of his passions, and he sprinkles note-taking instruction throughout his lessons.

Along the way, Barbour also came up with an ingenious strategy for improving students’ note-taking—he calls it the “test average method.” He tests his students twice, back-to-back: once, when they don’t use their notes (which incentivizes good studying), and a second time, when they use their notes (which incentivizes good note-taking). He then averages their scores. Barbour notes that this technique is more suitable for short subjective tests in multiple choice, matching, or true/false formats—he doesn’t use it for all tests.

He relies on his learning management system (LMS) to do the grading and averaging of everything except essay questions so that this tactic is not too time-intensive. Using this method, Barbour has seen some delightful results. “As we move forward in the semester, I often see the scores on the initial attempt rise significantly.

So sometimes the change between the first and the second attempt isn’t that big. And I see this progress with the students where they’re actually taking better notes and studying more. But I think there’s a third, ancillary benefit.

It’s reading! Because the students are reading for more comprehension—slower, rereading—to get better notes.” For more information on Barbour’s test average method, see his article for Edutopia, “ A Testing Strategy That Promotes Good Note-Taking Skills .”

## Transcript

Benjamin Barbour: One of my pet peeves is when teachers just say “take notes”—as though we were all born knowing the Cornell method or the outline method. This is just something everybody knows. And I did this for years. A few years ago, I asked students to take a photo of their notes, and I saw students often would just list two or three or four dozen facts—I called it the Giant List. No subheadings, no title, no date. And they didn’t always use the notes. So they didn’t really see how it could help them. I started to experiment with different ways of encouraging my students to use their notes, and I came up with the test average method. And what it entails is the students take my assessment once just using their brainpower, and when they are finished with that test, they can immediately take it a second time using any notes that they have written down. When they are completed with that second attempt, my learning management system averages those test scores. So that is their final score. The tests that work the best are multiple choice, true-and-false, matching, so that the learning management system does the bulk of the grading. The students still need to study. Because they know the test scores will be averaged, they are inclined to do well on that first attempt. However, allowing them to use their notes also encourages a different kind of studying, as the students rewrite their notes, add more detail to their notes; in many cases, they don’t even realize that this is studying. They think that they are just improving their notes and making them a little better for the test. So as the semester moves forward, I often see this progress with the students where they’re actually taking better notes and studying more. But I think there’s a third ancillary benefit: It’s reading. Because the students are reading from more comprehension, slower, rereading to get better notes. Because I have used this method, I see students engaging with the process, asking questions, and wanting to succeed, which is really fun and exhilarating as a teacher.

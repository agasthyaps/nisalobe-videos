## Article

Students at every grade level do 15 minutes of shared reading every day. (Download a PDF of the shared reading planning sheet .) They begin learning how to annotate in pre-kindergarten. (Download a PDF of the annotation descriptions for PK–1st Grade .) By second grade, they are ready to learn more complex annotation marks. (Download a PDF of the annotation descriptions for 2nd–5th Grade .) This video is part of our Schools That Work series and features key practices from Concourse Village Elementary School .

## Transcript

Student: Jazmin feels like she’s going to get into a good college and– Crystal Carrion: Because we do collaborative reading, we are helping every scholar feel successful, regardless of the reading level.

Teacher: So who is it about?

Student: Jazmin.

Crystal Carrion: Being able to synthesize the big ideas, form opinions, and share those. Those are skills that any contributing citizen of the world would need.

Student: What do you think about that?

Alexa Sorden: Our mission is to create critical thinkers, children that are able to communicate clearly their thoughts, their ideas. And as a result, are productive members of society.

Crystal Carrion: Collaborative reading is a reading approach where the scholars work with one another and share ideas.

Student: Little cat was walking down the street.

Crystal Carrion: It’s amazing because the kids are coming in at different levels, different learning styles. So whether you’re a higher reader or lower reader, we’re all going to break it down together.

Student: Why is this important?

Student: Because we want to better understand the text.

Genesis: What I like most about collaborative reading is you take all your ideas, put them together, and make one big thought. We all understand it.

Teacher: Scholars, we’re ready for collaborative reading.

Crystal Carrion: The structure of collaborative reading is broken into five phases. Each day is concentrating on a specific skill or idea.

Raquel Linares: Each phase has a question tailored to that skill that we want them to walk away with.

Student: We’re going to do phase one. We’re going to look for the main idea in chapter eight.

Students: I went directly to her office to ask how this obvious mistake had occurred.

Mia: So the text we’ve been reading is a book called Jazmin’s Notebook. Jazmin wants to be a writer. Ms. Wise, this counselor, wants her to stay at home, clean, cook, and to not follow her dreams.

Students: –that a person like yourself would be happier doing something with your hands.

Raquel Linares: After we read it, we go back to what was the main idea. Because if they understand that point, then it’ll be easier for them to build on it.

Student: Okay. So it’s not D. So we’re stuck with B or C.

Student: C says Jazmin didn’t believe she might get to college, but– Mia: We’ll choose an answer. We’ll discuss it with the class to see if we agree.

Student: Why do you guys think it’s B?

Student: The courses Ms. Wise picked for her will be fitting for her career as a best-selling author.

Student: Phase two is annotating the text for better understanding. We do it chunk by chunk, and we annotate key details that supports the gist.

Raquel Linares: This gives scholars an opportunity to really dissect. Some of the annotation markings are a star if there’s a section that’s really vital, arched arrows connecting ideas, question marks. By phase three, now we’re going to go back, look at those annotations. What inferences can we make here? We’re going to go back to our text to answer some questions.

Student: It could be A and it could be B.

Student: I’m leaning more towards A.

Student: Does everybody have a answer?

Students: Yes.

Student: Why do you guys think it’s A and not B, C, or D?

Student: She thinks Jazmin is not going to go to college. You could infer that she doesn’t believe in her.

Raquel Linares: Phase four, now, we’re looking closely at the author’s craft. So what was the message that was being conveyed with certain words or phrases?

Student: Me and her annotated that her name is very, like, ironic because she’s not that wise as her name says because Jazmin doesn’t want to do the courses she put her in to do.

Raquel Linares: Phase five is about bringing it all together. So they are thinking about a theme or drawing conclusions why the author wrote what he wrote.

Student: Summary of this excerpt would be Ms. Wise controlling Jazmin’s life.

Raquel Linares: So what goes after your claim? The way that we select texts for collaborative reading, we look at texts that are grade level and above grade level. So this approach is a perfect way for scholars to feel successful even if they are below and for us to push those who are already on grade level.

Mia: My favorite thing about collaborative reading is that, since we all hear other people’s ideas, we have a better understanding. And also, we have multiple days to figure out the meaning.

Crystal Carrion: Because we do collaborative readings, scholars get access to literacy in so many different ways. It’s through their sharing and their discussion, the process of the collaborative reading.

## Article

At Amana Academy in Alpharetta, Georgia, teachers use a tool called the NAEM Tracker to help kids self-assess where they are in their learning. The process also helps teachers decide whether to move on with the unit or reteach a lesson or concept. NAEM is an acronym: N is for Novice (“I don’t know much about this topic; it’s new to me”), A is for Apprentice (“I am aware of this topic and currently learning about it”), E is for Expert (“I understand the topic well and apply it”), and M is for Mentor (“I understand the topic well, can teach it to others, and support them in applying it”).

Students choose which description fits them best at the moment the teacher checks in. There are lots of different ways to have students do this, from raising their hands for each choice, to placing sticky notes on a NAEM Tracker poster board on their way out the door, to giving verbal answers. Typically teachers ask students to self-assess three times during the lesson—once at the start of class, once in the middle, and once at the end.

Not only do students take more ownership of their learning, but teachers can more efficiently plan their next lesson, knowing who’s got it down and who needs more support.

## Transcript

Mona Hussain: Think about where you are on the NAEM Tracker. Are you a novice? Are you an apprentice? Are you an expert? Are you a mentor? So the NAEM Tracker is an assessment tool, N-A-E-M. It helps us to gauge where the students are in their learning. So I start off the lesson, how they’re doing. How many of you feel like you are mentors? How many of you feel like you’re experts? N is for Novice, A is for Apprentice, E is for Expert, and M is for Mentor. Then in the middle of the lesson, you would do the same thing, quick check-in. What about the novel, too? So think about the anchor text.

Student: Mentor with the packet, and expert without.

Mona Hussain: So the end-of-the-lesson check-in can be a little bit different. I have left a sticky note here, and I want you to think about where you are on this. The benefit is to think about what the next lesson is going to be, whether we need to reteach or move on with the lesson. Thank you so much—you have been amazing. Muah muah muah!

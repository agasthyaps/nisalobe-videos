This video is part of our series on rapid resets , tools for de-escalation that can help teachers and students build resilience, calm their nervous systems, and bring their thinking brains back online. Special thanks to Resources for Resilience , an organization in Asheville, North Carolina, that trains educators in how to use these tools for themselves and with their students.

## Transcript

Leigh: Taking a walk is a great way for both the student and me to calm down.

Leigh: I’ve learned to take a walk sometimes at school when things are escalating and I can feel the anxiety coming on. And on some days, I’ll just take the whole class outside. “Let’s go for a walk.” And often, that sensing into that walk, thinking about how my body’s feeling as I take that walk, and now getting the students to do the very same thing, it’s like a reset for all of us.

Leigh: If I can get myself where I need to be, it’s much easier to get a student where they need to be.

Leigh: One of the things that I do when I walk with a student, is I start the walk really fast. And then to get them to coregulate, I start slowing down.

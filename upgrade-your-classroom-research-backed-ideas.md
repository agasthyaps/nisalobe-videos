A growing body of evidence shows that the design of a classroom can have a significant impact on the learning within. While some factors are out of teachers’ control, there are a handful of simple but effective ways teachers can make their classroom environments more conducive to learning. From trying more flexible seating to setting up zones for different functions or introducing potted plants and being more intentional about what’s on the walls, these inexpensive solutions help set up a classroom for success—before students even come back through the door.

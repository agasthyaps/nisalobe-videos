# A High School Rooted in Nature

> The founders of The Greene School dreamed of a place where teens could learn outdoors and explore the natural world—and they created it.

The Greene School ’s founder Dr. Amy Pratt imagined a school where students could deepen their understanding of the natural world, and in the process become much-needed stewards of the environment. After many years of planning and multiple iterations, this high school, located on a 74-acre campus of forest, wetlands, and meadows, has become a living laboratory where, in addition to weeks-long interdisciplinary investigations of science, math, and humanities, teens spend time learning outdoors to explore their relationship to nature, their community, and the world at large.

As a statewide tuition-free public charter school in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, the school pulls students from all corners of the state, and their backgrounds—and experiences with the outdoors—vary significantly. A strong orientation program is in place to help everyone get on board with what the school’s mission really means. Principal Alex Edelmann, who was one of the school’s founding teachers, explains, “Being an environmental steward is so much more than picking up your litter.

It’s about understanding how the land works and understanding our role and our ability to improve it.” Because the campus is decentralized, with small buildings that would look more at home on a campground than at a school, students must be prepared to go outdoors every single day. Even in the most challenging New England winter weather, students are outside—sometimes for field work and other times just to get from one class to another. “You can’t avoid being outside,” says head of school Kerry Tuttlebee.

“And to me, that allows students to be more open-minded, kind of naturally. Because immediately when you arrive here, often people say this doesn’t look like a school, doesn’t feel like a school. And it creates that sense of curiosity, like, ‘What is this place?

And how do they do things here?’ And that’s a great place to be with high school students.” To explore more stories about how teens learn outdoors at this innovative school, visit the Greene School page on Edutopia .

## Transcript

Dr.

Amy Pratt: In my short speech at graduation each year, I use a quote slightly adapted out of Last Child in the Woods , by Richard Louv, and it goes something like, “Education should not be a polite form of incarceration, but a portal to the wider world.” I think that this school, by getting kids outside, working in nature, on this campus, getting outside in other parts of the state, is important for them to understand their world around them.

Alex Edelmann: The Greene School is a small statewide charter school that focuses on environmental education. The campus is absolutely amazing. We’ve got a pond and forests and fields, wetlands. You can see kids walking around the campus throughout the entire school day.

Kerry Tuttlebee: You can’t avoid being outside, and to me, that allows students to be more open-minded kind of naturally, because immediately when you arrive here, often people say, “This doesn’t look like a school. It doesn’t feel like a school.” And it creates that sense of curiosity. Like, “Huh. What is this place?” and like, “How do they do things here?” And that’s a great place to be with high school students.

Alex Edelmann: Any given day, you can see kids who are out down at the pond in an outdoor classroom or out by that black walnut tree and have a literature circle out there or do a math lesson. So there’s a lot of really wonderful instructional space.

Batoul: You’re literally, almost halfway.

Roman: Yeah, Hunter.

Batoul: He’s taken big steps.

Student: Yeah, Hunter.

Alex Edelmann: We see the climbing tower and the other elements we have on campus as tools for students to not only be learning outdoor education, but they’re learning so much more about who they are as a leader, who they are as a community member, and what it really means to truly support one another.

Batoul: I learned with the climbing tower and a lot of stuff that we do, I’m not much of a risk-taker, but I know that when I push myself to do those things, and especially when I see a lot of others around me doing the things, I’m more encouraged to do it.

Alex Edelmann: I think that the outdoor education program sort of naturally is lending itself to that classroom experience.

Batoul: No. What does that tell you? It just gives us— Teacher: Nope. So you got to talk about what that means as far as the linear relationship.

Roman: To the third degree.

Roman: A lot of the skills that you learn when you’re outside, working with other people, also come into classwork. It’s taught me to have more resilience and more collaboration.

Kerry Tuttlebee: Our students spend plenty of time in more traditional structured classrooms, but how we’re using that time is typically pretty different.

Student: It traps the bacteria inside of it and lets it grow to eat the other organics.

Kerry Tuttlebee: Here, we expect you to lean into this, even if it’s uncomfortable.

Teacher: The slope, which is that number in front of x , the coefficient, is negative, so as one value increases— Student: Other decreases.

Teacher: …the other value is decreasing.

Alex Edelmann: Teachers are able to put kids in the driver’s seat by giving them information and essential questions to unpack, but they’re not telling them how to get there. There’s opportunities for students to be investigators and explorers and researchers as they’re digging into their studies in a really different way.

Student: [inaudible 00:03:40] Ben, you got that right? Ben, right here. Right here, Ben.

Student:[inaudible 00:03:44] Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Student: Good shot, bro.

Kerry Tuttlebee: One of the things that stands out to me is our emphasis on trust, so explicitly devoting time to building connections and relationships, explicitly designing lunch periods so students have some freedom and flexibility. We trust our staff. We trust our students to not be perfect, but to be working in the best interests of the community and themselves, and we are creating those conditions.

Alex Edelmann: One of the things that we’re working hard to do is foster relationships in Crew.

Teacher: I thought that our first challenge today would be the Human Knot.

Kerry Tuttlebee: Crew is like advisory, but advisory-plus, and so it’s a chance for a small group of students to be connected to each other and the same crew leader over all four years of their high school.

Student: Yeah, I’m holding Juliana.

Kerry Tuttlebee: Crew meets every day except Wednesdays and is a half an hour each day. In Crew, students get to know each other better, build those relationships, and have team-building time.

Teacher: Do you feel like you could have attempted this activity in ninth grade when you just met each other?

Student: No, not even kind of.

Ben: When I do stuff like that and become more comfortable with my friends and surroundings, I’ll speak out more in class, and I won’t be afraid to raise my hand and I’ll communicate more with my fellow peers.

Student: Are we going to have multiple of these statements?

Student: No.

Ben: Because these are just to get big stuff up, so 99 percent will get out with this one.

Alex Edelmann: Dr. Pratt wanted a school where students from across the state could come together and have an opportunity to engage in environmental stewardship. I think some students think about environmental stewardship as, “If I see litter on the ground, I’m going to pick it up.” Student: I can develop a prototype design for my water filter.

Alex Edelmann: Being an environmental steward is so much more than picking up your litter. I think it’s about understanding how the land works and understanding our role and our ability to improve it.

Teacher: Let’s just say you hit it with disinfection and then you start doing a bunch of things to it, that— Alex Edelmann: We want 100 percent of our kids leaving here understanding those pillars of sustainability. The fact that we have this 70-acre laboratory for not just science, but for people to be exploring themselves and relationships and dynamics, that’s a really amazing thing. This campus is an amazing place.

Dr.

Amy Pratt: My hope is that the students who graduate from this school can all see the world a little differently and understand that we are sharing the world together, and we need to work together to help move through the problems that face our planet.

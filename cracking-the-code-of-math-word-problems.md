## Article

While math word problems are widely used in classrooms at all grade levels to help put numbers, operations, and equations into context and connect math to the real world, they also increase the cognitive load for students, who must parse the surrounding narrative text and distill the math. A 2025 study shows that not all the strategies that students use for making sense of it are created equal. After looking at over 1,000 solutions that middle school students came up with for three different word problems, researchers found that the most commonly used strategy—highlighting the essential elements—only helped a little.

But when paired with other organizational strategies, like pulling out key bits of information, sketching diagrams, and annotating with arrows or labels to help draw connections between parts of a problem, they were 29 percent more likely to solve the problem correctly. Strategies like these work because many math word problems, even simple ones, offer more information than students’ working memories are able to hold. By transferring some of that data onto paper as they draw, annotate, and map out relationships, students free up more brain space for solving the math problem itself.

A different study, also released in 2025 , showed that the most capable problem-solvers were skilled at offloading the extra information from their working memory by writing it down, before reintegrating it as they translated and solved the problem.

Narrator: Even simple word problems can derail students as they wade through a tangle of numbers, operations, and story details. After analyzing over 1,000 solutions to word problems from middle school classrooms, researchers discovered that students often stumbled when trying to break narrative text down into manageable, computable steps. According to a 2025 study, what may seem like a simple scenario—the weight of the gold stolen by bank robbers pulling a heist, for example—can exert high demands on working memory as information outstrips cognitive bandwidth. Without the right tools, students can flounder. In the study, the most common technique, highlighting key elements of a word problem, was only marginally helpful. But when used with other organizational strategies, such as isolating key details, sketching diagrams, or annotating with arrows or labels that explicitly map relationships between parts of a problem, students were better able to see how the pieces fit together. Why do these tactics work? When a problem is too complex to hold all at once in memory, committing details to paper allows students to offload some of their thinking, freeing up mental workspace and allowing for greater focus on the elements that matter. Word problems are meant to illustrate math as it works in the real world—that’s important. But to solve these problems, students need to be able to break the stories down to reveal the math beneath the surface.

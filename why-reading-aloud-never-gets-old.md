All too many educators abandon read-alouds past elementary school, but research shows that the practice can have a powerful impact on older kids too. From teachers modeling their thinking process while reading in front of the class to parsing academic texts in other subjects, creating a culture of reading starts with reading out loud.

## Transcript

You can see the evidence on their faces. When students are young, teacher read-alouds are a cherished routine. The practice—and all the magic that goes with it—tends to fade away as students transition into middle and high school. Probably because kids learn to read independently and read alouds are deemed developmentally inappropriate. But the act of reading poses new challenges at every stage of development, as students confront complex narratives, figurative language, and specialized vocabulary. Research shows that read-alouds continue to benefit learners well beyond the elementary years by demonstrating advanced reading techniques, encouraging kids to engage with the materials more deeply, and reducing reading-related stress. Reading is more than just knowing the literal meaning of the words on a page. It’s about seeing patterns, grappling with nuance, and making logical inferences from the text. But students might be reading superficially or mechanically without explicit modeling from teachers. During read-alouds, consider stopping periodically to talk through how you would tackle confusing information, such as looking up unknown words, using context clues, re-reading, or summarizing when necessary. Pause to ask students questions, too, so they can discuss plotlines, themes, and character development in a story. This lowers the pressure of reading and challenges the belief that students need to get everything on the first try. Read-alouds have a place across the curriculum to help students parse through jargon-rich texts in biology, physics, or history. Take the time to identify common terms together, then have the class define them beforehand. Use read-alouds to help students wrestle with new concepts and ask probing questions that connect to previous lessons. Showing readers how to reconstruct information and connect it to prior learning— whether through note-taking in the margins or class discussion— makes learning specialized materials more digestible. Read-alouds are sometimes criticized for being passive listening activities, but that’s a misconception. Try taking the last five minutes of class to read aloud from a book chosen by your students. This gives them a chance to share topics of interest, discuss social issues relevant to their lives, and connect the reading to each other’s life experiences. Students will leave the classroom talking about the book and anticipating what will happen next, which creates a sustained sense of community and enthusiasm for reading.

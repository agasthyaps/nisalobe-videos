The use of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in the classroom has sparked debate in the education community. Proponents argue that these tools can significantly aid students, while skeptics, including teachers, express concern. A 2024 study on how AI affects learning —involving approximately 1,000 high school students—explored this issue.

In question was students’ ability to effectively integrate AI assistance into their learning and distinguish between AI assistance and their own understanding. The research tasked students with attending a math lesson and then solving related problems using either traditional methods—like notes and textbooks—or AI tools, including a basic version of ChatGPT and a specially developed AI tutor. Initially, students using AI tools showed remarkable improvements, with those using the basic and tutor versions scoring 48 percent and 127 percent better than their peers, respectively.

However, this success was short-lived: On a closed-book test of the same skills, the scores of the students who had used AI plummeted. The study revealed that students using the basic ChatGPT engaged in superficial interactions, frequently asking the AI direct questions like “What is the answer?” The researchers concluded that unsupervised use of AI during skill-building phases can become a hindrance—and potentially limit learning. Despite these challenges, AI’s potential in education should not be dismissed.

The software has shown promise when it has been custom-designed to facilitate learning, such as by refusing to provide direct answers and instead prompting students with probing questions. The research on how AI affects learning shows that while the technology is advancing rapidly, it is not yet ready to replace teachers. AI remains limited by the capabilities of its human creators, highlighting the need for careful integration into educational practices to enhance, rather than inhibit, student learning.

## Transcript

Narrator: Boosters of AI chatbots in educational settings say the tools can assist in activities like brainstorming or help students solve tough math problems. Teachers are skeptical. They say their students lack the skills to enhance what AI produces, or the maturity or self-awareness to know where AI ends and their own responsibility for learning begins. So who’s right? A 2024 study observed roughly 1,000 high school students as they attended a math lesson, then practice solving related problems. Some students used traditional methods, sifting through their notes and textbooks to solve the problems. Well, others used a basic version of ChatGPT or a special AI tutor that had been developed with help from classroom teachers. The results were a minor miracle, until they were a catastrophe. Students using the basic and tutor GPTs scored an astonishing 48% and 127% better than their AI free-peers respectively. But when the same students went to retrieve the information during a closed book test, their math skills had gone up in smoke test performance of the students who had used the basic version of ChatGPT dropped so steeply, in fact, that they scored 17% below their peers who had relied on pen and paper. Tellingly, students using ChatGPT basic engaged in only very superficial conversations with the software, and their most common question was, “What’s the answer?” Unsupervised use of AI during active skill building can quickly become a crutch and actually runs the risk of inhibiting learning, the researchers concluded. But don’t count AI out just yet. In multiple studies, the software performed well when it was custom-designed to guide learning, when it refused to give away answers or asked students probing follow-up questions, for example. The software is making rapid progress but isn’t ready to replace teachers. AI remains chained to the paradox of its origins. For now at least, it’s only as smart as its human makers.

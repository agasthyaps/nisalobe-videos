## Transcript

Teacher: We’re going to start our writing. We have seven minutes, begin. We use seven-minute writes close to daily. It’s an idea generator. Like, if you only have seven minutes, it’s just about, like, getting out a bunch of ideas. So you write, homework should be banned, or schools need school resource officers. Today they wrote for seven minutes on two different topics. I tell the kids, like just get something out there first. Seven minutes on the clock. And then something cool is going to come out of that and we’ll work on refining it from there.

Student: Cops are very useful in many ways, like saving people’s lives. They know that they’re going to have to share it right away, and there’s excitement around that.

Student: I wrote that, I agree that we shouldn’t have homework, because we have other things to do at home. For example– Teacher: They’re listening to feedback from one another. That’s a skill that our students need to have. One thing that I love about seven-minute writes is that it’s its own instructional tool. It’s writing to learn.

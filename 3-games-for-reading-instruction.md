## Article

Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St. Lawrence (or “Ms.

Saint,” as she’s called by her students) is passionate about literacy. She knows that keeping it playful is critical for learning. In her second-grade class at Harford Heights Elementary in Baltimore, Maryland, she sprinkles in fun games to reinforce new concepts during direct reading instruction.

In Diving for Digraphs, pairs of kids “dive” into an inflatable kiddie pool filled with shredded paper and pull out laminated words containing vowel team digraphs. The students must say their words correctly out loud and determine if they are spelled correctly (some of the words in the pool are intentionally misspelled). They then show their words to the class, and the class agrees or disagrees.

This gives students the chance to teach each other phonics—for example, a student may point out that the word “payn” is incorrect because the a-y vowel team always goes at the end of a word. The diving repeats until everyone has had a turn. In order to practice word chaining, students play a game akin to musical chairs.

Kids dance around the room to music (Ms. Saint hails from Barbados, and her students especially love it when she plays music from her home country). When she stops the music, everyone freezes.

Ms. Saint calls out a word, which they have to write down on their mini-whiteboards. When they hear “Boards up!” they hold up their boards for Ms.

Saint to check. Students who get it wrong have to sit down; they have the chance to rejoin the game if they get it right on the next round. The music starts again, and this time when they freeze, Ms.

Saint tells them to change one sound (for example, if they’re starting with the word “gain,” she tells them to drop the “guh” and add an “mmm,” resulting in a new word, “main”). “ If they can successfully delete and add and substitute sounds,” she says, “that tells me they’re ready for comprehension. That tells me they’re one step closer to being a fluent reader.

They’re spending less of their brain power sounding out and trying to decode words.” In addition to using games in whole group activities, Ms. Saint has devised games for station rotation time. Take Sight Word Jenga, in which she’s written sight words on the long sides of Jenga blocks.

In order to get a point, kids must remove a block from the Jenga tower and correctly pronounce the word that’s revealed. If they mispronounce a word, the next player gets a chance to say it correctly and win that block. When the tower tumbles, whoever has the most blocks wins.

Ms. Saint points out that the benefits of gamifying instruction go well beyond the content. Turn-taking games are especially important for developing students’ social and emotional skills.

And all the games encourage good sportsmanship. Games often feel lower-stakes to students, who are more likely to take academic risks by participating or guessing an answer than in more formal class time. Many games also naturally build movement breaks into the day.

Ms. Saint does take special care to make sure the games, though physical, are inclusive to all her students. “With the support of an aide,” she says, “kids with physical challenges can participate.” If she wants to use a game, “then it is my job to modify it so that it meets their needs.

I have not yet met a game that I have not been able to modify!” For more playful activities and games that help teach reading, check out Kendall Stallings’s article for Edutopia, “ 6 Ways to Get Students Moving in Elementary Literacy Instruction .”

## Transcript

Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: You are going to use the word skirt, skirt. When you have kids who struggle with reading, with the games, it’s given them the self-confidence. They’re like, “Oh, I can do this.” Boards up. So, I’m seeing more, taking the initiative to answer questions in class or to engage in discussion.

Student: S-K-I-R-T. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: Excellent job. Last one, let’s go. Harford Heights is not just a school, it’s a community. We look at the kids holistically. And sometimes, in order to address their academic needs, we need to address their other needs. Literacy is so important in second grade, because second grade is usually the last time kids will be learning about blending and sounding out. When they hit third grade, they’re reading for comprehension. Good morning, everyone.

Harlee: Today, in Ms. Saint’s class, we played a lot of games. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: Gamifying instruction allows them to get that information that they need in a fun way. So far, we have done what vowel team words?

Harlee: E-E. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: E-E. Student 4: E-Y? Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: E-Y.

Harlee: The diving game, we had a pool with scraps of paper. Two people take the shoes off and jump in and find words. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: And then when they come out, they have to sound out the word.

Student: Delayed. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: Delayed.

Student: L, ee, flee? Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: Are those the correct spellings of the words?

Student: Yes. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: And then, they show their classmates and the class would agree or disagree. And then after that, the next group goes, and we keep going until everybody has had a turn. With the support of an aide, kids with physical challenges can participate in the game. If I want to use the games, then it’s my job to modify it so that it meets their needs.

Student: Tail. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: Tail. Physical games are so important because kids need to move. You put them where they have to use their body to move around, where they have to touch or squeeze something or use a manipulative. The concepts stick. Sight Word Jenga, it is usually a small group activity. They take turns trying to get the tiles out without the tower tumbling, but they also have to say the word correctly.

Khyion: Many. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: You are absolutely right. In addition to learning their sight words, they are also getting some social-emotional skills. It’s a good turn-taking game. They have to be patient as other people work. It’s a tangible, kinesthetic activity, connecting, reading to your muscles, pushing that word out and maybe seeing it slowly reveal. Something is going to lock into their brain.

Khyion: If you don’t know the word, you got to pass it on to someone else. I like that game because it helps improve my reading. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: We are now going to play our musical chains. Musical chains lets them get some moving in, but it also lets them practice those higher-order skills, the link chaining.

Harlee: Ms. Saint turns on some music. You can dance around. When the music stops, you have to freeze and you have to write down the words that she says. Kathy-Ann St. Hill-St.

Lawrence: Gain, gain. The word is gain. Boards up. It gives me a quick way to check and see whether when they hear a word, they can spell it. If they can successfully delete and add and substitute sounds, then that tells me they’re spending less of their brain power sounding out and trying to decode words. They’re one step closer to being a fluent reader. Drop the “gah” and add a “mmm”… boards up. One of the great things about games is that they don’t realize they’re learning. They think it’s just a big dance party. One day you’ll give them a question or we have a test, and then they’re like, “Oh, I know that.” It also teaches good sportsmanship. Second graders have very big emotions. They’re now more willing to be wrong, and they’re OK with other people correcting them. It’s not the end of the world. So, can you help her figure out why she shouldn’t put the E?

Student: You only use E when you’re using a hard word or tricky one that you don’t know, so that’s the only time you’ll…

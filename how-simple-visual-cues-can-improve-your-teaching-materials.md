File this study in your simple-but-effective strategies folder. When creating teaching materials like instructional videos or slides, a 2020 study concluded that adding annotations like arrows, text labels, or circles can provide “visual scaffolding” that clarifies your teaching priorities and guides student focus and attention. Students who were exposed to materials with visual cues outperformed students who saw the same materials without cues by about 9 percentage points.

## Transcript

Narrator: Here’s a quick research-based tip to improve your instructional materials. When creating slides or instructional videos, try visual and text keys to highlight key information. In a 2020 study, researchers looked at instructional materials with and without visual cues and found that simple annotations can improve recall by as much as nine percentage points. In the study, the researchers used eye-tracking technology to analyze where students focused, as they considered geographic information. When no cues were present, students looked almost exclusively at the title of the map. But students shifted their attention when annotations like crosshatches, arrows or circles, for example, highlighted key information. And adding text cues to the other visual cues further boosted the students’ ability to recall the lesson in the future. It’s just a little reminder that students learn better when they get guidance and support, even if it’s very simple. The cues provide visual scaffolding that directs students’ attention to crucial details, the researchers explained. So, how should make use of them? Be sparing, and don’t pepper your materials with annotations, but do use visual cues and text strategically to bring students back to attention, emphasize important idea or concepts in your instructional videos and slides, and clarify your learning priorities. That strategy will encourage students to process the material more deeply, generating memory traces that aid retention far into the future.

## Article

Socratic seminars are common in middle and high school, but at Barbara Morgan STEM Academy in Meridian, Idaho, fourth-grade teacher Ricky Clark sees their value for much younger learners. His elementary students are well-versed in using a modified version of a Socratic seminar to build up their speaking skills and get practice in giving peer critique. As with Socratic seminars in higher grade levels , the structure includes an inner circle and an outer circle.

In this adapted version, the inner circle is given eight minutes to have an academic discussion. Clark has a list of prompts that he has developed with the other fourth-grade teachers on his team, and throughout that time, he moves students on to a new topic about every two minutes. The short chunks help keep the conversation on track and allow multiple opportunities for different students to participate.

At the same time, students in the outer circle have been assigned a person from the inner circle to observe. While the inner circle answers the prompts, students in the outer ring use an observation circle feedback sheet to note things like engagement in the discussion, eye contact, and relevance of the contributions. There is also a section of the sheet that asks if their designated participant missed any opportunities within the discussion.

Once the eight minutes is up and the discussion is over, the outer circle shares their feedback with the inner circle, including what they did well and where they could improve. Clark loves using Socratic seminars in elementary school because they bring benefits to everyone in the classroom. “I believe they’re building their confidence in having discussions.

They can articulate their thoughts, they can become engaged, and they can give that feedback,” he says. “They can be critical and still be nice, knowing that it can be constructive.”

## Transcript

Ricky Clark: Good luck, guys. The Socratic seminar starts now. Because our students do Socratic seminars, they become more confident in having a dialogue. They’re just building their confidence in having discussions. It’s a big step for fourth grades. Student 2: That proves that they got probably killed from a volcano.

Ricky Clark: OK, let’s get ready for the Socratic seminar, please. The Socratic seminar, the main intention is to produce dialogue out of the kids, engage the kids in a conversation, and give feedback. There is a structure. You have to have one timekeeper. Inside circle, are you ready?

Students: Yes.

Ricky Clark: Timer, are you ready? OK, let’s start. What artifacts might be found during an excavation in Idaho? Student 4: Archaeologists have uncovered projectile points in Idaho that date back nearly 16,000 years.

Makani: You can also find some human-made features that are old, like the Oregon Trail and Lewis and Clark Trail.

Ricky Clark: The inner circle has a discussion for eight minutes. That’s where all the action is being taken, all the talking. List examples of how Earth changes over time.

Makani: Water erodes rock. Over time, you know— Student 4: I agree with you. In the Hells Canyon, it gets deeper every day, because [inaudible 00:01:28]— Makani: The inner circle’s job is to just act like the outer circle isn’t there, and to just talk back and forth about our questions.

Ricky Clark: We’ve got one minute left. And the outer circle is the feedback circle, so they’re listening, they’re taking notes.

Jax: Today, I was the outer circle, so I technically just had to research one person and see how they did. If they did pretty good, if they needed to work on some stuff.

Ricky Clark: They have a targeted person they’re observing. Then they have certain questions that they’re looking for. Student 2: Try putting fires out, because at the place there’s lots of fires and getting rid of the brush.

Ricky Clark: Stop. A round of applause for our inside circle. OK, outside circle, collaborate with your peers on who you observed. You’ve got a couple minutes, and then we’ll share out. Go. After the inner circle, they get together and share some of the notes. Student 7: I feel like he didn’t really share on that one, so I kind of wish that he jumped in there more—on that one, at least.

Ricky Clark: And after that, then they’ll give their feedback, and I really try to get that feedback to be encouraging, to be critical, but yet have suggestions for improvement.

Jax: She was. She had really good explaining. Her talking was very specific. There wasn’t any disunderstanding. Every Socratic seminar she’s been in, she’s been really good. This time, she was really on point. There was barely any mistakes. Student 8: She also could have asked a clarifying question.

Ricky Clark: The whole reason for the Socratic seminar is to create that dialogue, that they can articulate their thoughts, that they can become engaged, and that they can give that feedback, and still be nice being critical. One more round of applause for the inside circle. Thank you. This concludes our Socratic seminar.

## Transcript

Jess Scherer: The reason that we’re here today is we are going to go on a learning walk to look at different ways that some of our teachers are using their flexible spaces. We’re looking to become more of a facilitator… Jeff Walters: The power of the professional development on campus is that all of our staff gets to learn from one another. It’s all about transforming teaching and learning and building a culture of collaboration.

Jeff Walters: At Kettle Moraine High School, we place priorities on transforming our campus and part of that is changing what our space looks like to allow teachers to move from in front of the classroom and allow students to really own that learning.

Jess Scherer: We’ve been working to really personalize to different learners and allow our students to choose where they feel they’ll learn best. Creed (Student): Classrooms with more open space instead of rows of desks it makes a lot easier to work with other people.

Jess Scherer: Over the last seven years most of our spaces have changed and we’re right now changing over the last few classrooms. Our social studies department is going to be getting their new furniture next year, and as part of their transition, we took them on a learning walk.

Jess Scherer: So we’re looking to continue to empower students through choice of where they’re sitting, who they’re choosing to work with. Kind of be looking for things that you maybe want to replicate for your space.

Pam Martin: A learning walk is a way for teachers to get out and view other teachers in their environment.

Jess Scherer: Spread out as we get in.

Trey Korte: In my room, rather than having everyone in the class reading the same book, I’ve actually been able to put them into different groups with furniture that can be easily moved by students, and then they can lead their own discussions and they have a lot more ownership in their learning. (Student): ….but she’s like so focused on like pleasing others. (Student): I think that kind of makes her unlikable to the reader a little bit.

Pam Martin: They were sharing out ideas. A lot of what they were discussing was very high-level critical thinking, to share out in a large group might have been very intimidating for them. So the smaller groups worked really well.

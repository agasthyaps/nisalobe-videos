At Success Academy Charter Schools , a network of more than 50 public charter schools in New York City, every student from grades K–12 spends time reading in school—every single day. For the youngest learners, teachers start with 10 or 20 minutes at a stretch, but by the time students are in middle school, they may spend up to an hour each day reading. In sixth-grade literacy teacher Kasey Delgado’s class, she helps build stamina for the culture of daily reading by offering multiple activities to keep students engaged, from small group book clubs to whole class discussions about the latest novels or nonfiction they’re working through together.

Book choice is a key part of the equation. According to eighth-grade student Kadiatou, “We have multiple opportunities to read. About an hour every day, we’re spending reading.

We choose what books we want to read. There’s a book library at the back of every room.” “I think it’s one of the most important design elements (of our network), that every child reads in school,” says network founder Eva Moskowitz. “And some people might say, ‘Couldn’t they just read at home?’ Well, they also read at home. (But) we think reading is such a good use of the kids’ time that we read in school every single day.

We read great books that the children choose based on their interests. We think that’s really valuable.” And this intense focus on a culture of daily reading has paid off—it’s one of the many reasons over 16,000 families applied for the lottery for 3,200 spots at Success Academy schools this academic year. Across the network, 80 percent of students scored passing or above on the state tests in English language arts, compared with 52 percent of students passing statewide.

## Transcript

Kasey Delgado: But everything about riding the bus was humiliating for Black passengers. All riders entered through the front door… Student: It just shows that someone’s going to do something, and it’s going to like have a big impact on the book moving forward.

Eva Moskowitz: I think it’s one of the most important design elements. At Success Academy, every child reads in school. And some people might say, “Well, couldn’t they just read at home?” Well, they also read at home. But we think reading is so valuable and such a good use of the kids’ time that we read in school every single day.

Kadiatou: Throughout the school, we have multiple opportunities to read. About an hour every day, we’re spending reading. We choose what books we want to read. There’s a book library at the back of every room.

Eva Moskowitz: We read great books that the children choose based on their interests. In the beginning of school, it’s a little shorter. The kindergartners are reading for 10 minutes, and they kind of work their way up to 30 minutes a day. In middle school, it’s about 45 minutes a day.

Kasey Delgado: Building stamina for reading and building a love for reading do kind of go hand in hand. We have small groups where they can talk a little bit more in depth about the reading.

Kadiatou: You get to go into detail, talk about the common themes you see in the book, and all of that really just adds on to your understanding of the book.

Kasey Delgado: Medusa is somebody who could turn people to stone, right? What kind of parallels do we see in the text right now as we’re reading to those ideas that we talked about?

Kasey Delgado: That’s really their time to just kind of explore reading where they are most comfortable. But also still working in things like literary devices and the reasons why authors foreshadow.

Ukasha: Like, that can be like towards the end of the book where he figures out all about his mother.

Kasey Delgado: We do have our regular ELA classes where we’re talking about whole class novels.

Kasey Delgado: You read a couple of examples, and we’re going to revisit those examples a little bit later in the class.

Kasey Delgado: We’re reading Claudette Colvin, Twice Toward Justice , and it is a nonfiction text.

Kasey Delgado: We’re going to try to see where we see this language come up again in the text.

Kasey Delgado: In class, we really like to dive deeper into the language. And what do these words make us think? What does this quote make us think?

Kasey Delgado: What is Claudette trying to tell us about riding the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, at that time?

Kasey Delgado: The guiding question for today was, why does riding the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, at this time feel like a sore tooth that never quits aching?

Ukasha: It hurts a lot, and it’s just very irritating.

Ukasha: It’s a very interesting book because it talks about segregation, it’s a very heavy topic. Like, a lot of people, they went through a lot. It really helps me understand, like I should be grateful for the people who fought towards justice. I love reading because like, it really helps me understand life more.

Kasey Delgado: One really good thing about this book… Kasey Delgado: I think that really gives them the opportunity to really be more exposed to what is going on in the world through literacy.

Eva Moskowitz: We find it incredibly productive when the children read in school. We have been very, very successful because all of our kids learn to read.

Student: The people of color in Montgomery, they were always prevented from like making a difference, but I feel like now they’re trying to stand up and like go against that and actually make a difference with all these incidents.

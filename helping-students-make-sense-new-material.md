# Helping Students Make Sense of New Material

> These four metacognitive activities help students connect new lessons to prior learning, find patterns, and assess their strengths and weaknesses by articulating what they know and what they don’t.

## Transcript

Narrator: The introduction of new material is part of the regular rhythm of the classroom, but for many students it can feel confusing. A new lesson can feel like a disembodied concept rather than a piece of the puzzle they’ve been putting together all along. Here are four tried-and-true activities to help students build their metacognitive muscles, so they can evaluate and make sense of new material and grow as competent, independent learners.

Narrator: To help students connect new content to their knowledge base, researcher Kripa Sundar suggests having them sketch out a concept map, a diagram that shows the relationship between ideas and information. Students start by brainstorming everything they know about a given topic, listing any relevant terms or ideas; then they can use arrows, symbols, and colors to show connections between the ideas.

Narrator: When beginning a new unit, math coach Kristen Acosta likes to start off with an “I notice, I wonder” exercise. Students spend a few minutes verbalizing or writing down what facts and information they notice about this new topic; next they discuss with a partner; finally they write or share what they wonder about it, which encourages more abstract thinking. This strategy builds confidence by allowing students to explore what they may or may not know in a low-stakes environment. There are no wrong questions—everyone may notice and wonder something different.

Narrator: To scaffold learning new words and concepts, literacy specialist Rebecca Alber asks students to create a three-column “What do I know?” chart. Students write new vocabulary under “Know it,” “Sort of know it,” and “Don’t know it at all”; then they loosely define the terms they say they know or kind of know, so that teachers get a sense where to focus instruction. Students often overestimate how much they comprehend a concept. Asking them to identify and then define new terms will help them recognize what they genuinely understand.

Narrator: Since many students are hesitant to ask questions, even when they’re unsure about new material, biology professor Kimberly Tanner urges them to examine their muddiest point, the place where things got confusing or complicated. At the end of a lesson, students do a quick write on index cards, answering the prompt “What was most confusing to me about the material being explored in class today?” Regular examination of the muddiest point sets a tone that confusion is a part of learning and that articulating, embracing, and wrestling with this confusion are important parts of the process.

Narrator: Grappling with new material can be an empowering, rather than anxiety-inducing, experience for students. Activities like these help them take charge of their learning by prompting them to ask their own questions rather than simply answering yours.

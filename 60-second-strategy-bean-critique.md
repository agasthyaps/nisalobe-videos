## Transcript

Teacher: Take your computer, open it up, so that everyone can see your work. We are going to do a bean critique. So the bean critique is one way of students giving feedback and receiving it. When a peer gives them feedback, they think about it a little bit more, and they’re more accepting. So the students are given two beans. You will go around and you will look at each person’s web page. And I only want you thinking about the aesthetic look, color, font family, size, and the text alignment. They will observe all the pieces and then after they’ve seen all of the work, they place two beans on person’s work, or you can pick two people’s work. Then we look at the pieces that received the most beans.

Student: I thought it was really colorful.

Student: The fonts draw you in a bit more.

Teacher: The students are seeing work that meets a goal and how they can change their work, so that it is better meeting the goal.

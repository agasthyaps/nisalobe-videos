# Creating Opportunities for Unstructured Play

> When schools make space for free play in a natural environment, students are left to their own devices to build, create, and problem-solve—and the benefits continue once they are back in the classroom.

After a storm took a few trees down in their yard, Dyce Primary School in Aberdeen, Scotland, asked the city to leave them untouched in order to create a wild space for their students to explore, take risks, and play freely—and the results exceeded expectations. Students built up their resilience, as they had the chance to fail and practice iterating on their work, developed key social skills like ability to negotiate and solve problems both independently and collaboratively, and came back into the classroom more focused.

## Transcript

Jenny Watson: Well-being is absolutely top of the agenda in Scotland right now for their education. It is worrying looking at statistics of mental health, physical health. So, we have to help the children, give them the time to play, allow that joy of being outside.

Watson: Woody Play is a space that we have that’s got trees that the children can climb. It’s got areas that they can explore. Every class has an hour of Woody Play each week right from Primary 1 to Primary 7. Play session out there is a very free play. There’s no structure. Quite often teachers will take out different provocations, and that might be tarps, it might be sticks, it might be tires, it might be ropes.

Emma Hart: Some of them like to chit-chat—that’s great. Some of them want to make dens. Some of them want to climb a tree. But they become more like children.

Lucy: When we go down to this area and we can, like—we use the nature to, like, be creative. Like, make dens, like, make art in the leaves. It’s quite a good opportunity to, like, let our minds run wild.

Watson: We do encourage them, you know, to take risks and to explore, and test their own boundaries.

Student: I’ve got to try to tuck it in maybe.

Student: Yes, that’s what I mean, tuck it in.

Hart: Actually, for me taking a step back was the biggest issue. That not always interrupting and going, “Well, what are you learning there? Why are you doing that? What are you doing? You should do it this way.” And if you left them for a little bit longer than felt comfortable at the beginning, they actually worked out all those stages by themselves.

Student: We’ll get the [inaudible] to help us, too [laughter].

Student: OK.

Lucy: You get to learn, like, it’s kind of like problem-solving if you’re trying to make something. Because it doesn’t always, like, work the first time. And I think it’s fun because you just get to play about and stuff.

Student: Pulling, I’m pulling it in the back.

Student: Oh, yes, yes.

Student: Please, please.

Watson: I feel very strongly that we can only build resilience in young people by letting them have these experiences, by letting them try. They need to test their own boundaries, see what they can do. And we’re seeing that transfers back into the classroom, so that when they’re doing their more formal literacy and numeracy curricular areas, they’re far more engaged and motivated to do those, as well.

Hart: One of the biggest things that I was afraid of at the beginning was saying, “Oh, what if it doesn’t look like the children are learning?” They are learning. They’re just learning something that might not be so visible at the moment.

Student: Yay, we managed. We made it!

## Article

In middle and high school science classrooms, time and attention can often feel like they are in short supply. But starting the year off by scaffolding habits and developing resources that set students up for success can go a long way in maximizing science learning time and minimizing distractions, so that educators can keep students focused—and rekindle their natural curiosity about the world around them. Posting daily objectives and starting each class period with a related “do now” helps get everyone on the same page, while using instructional strategies like the scientist circle—where students face each other and contribute ideas—gives every student a voice and encourages them to articulate their thinking.

Putting anchor charts and other visual resources, especially student-generated ones, up on the walls can help students become more independent thinkers, eventually turning to the posters for reference instead of asking teachers for help, and sharing a progress tracker that helps students monitor their ongoing investigations and celebrate their findings keeps the whole class on track.

## Transcript

Narrator: Student engagement can be a challenge, especially as students move into middle and high school, when their enthusiasm and willingness to participate may begin to fade. Science class is a great place to rekindle their natural curiosity about the world around them, and building classroom routines that set everyone up for success can go a long way in maximizing science time and minimizing distractions.

Narrator: Bringing enthusiasm about the work that needs to be done sets the tone for a class that is ready to get right down to the business of learning. Try an opening activity that connects directly to the learning goal for the day and focuses student attention on the topic you’ll be tackling. Use the first five minutes of class to share your excitement about the topic and clearly communicate the day’s objective. Ask students to jot down what resources they’ll use to meet it as a do-now before you dive in. You’ll be launching your lesson with everyone on the same page.

Narrator: Making room for discussing ideas as a whole class resembles how real scientists work together. After students have had an opportunity to grapple with a concept individually, try bringing them together in a scientists’ circle. Gather students in a horseshoe to share their ideas. Ask the class to build on each other’s thoughts, and have kids use hand signals to indicate agreement or dissent so that everyone is taking part. You’ll be sending the message that collaboration is important, and everyone’s voice is a critical part of the conversation.

Narrator: Taking stock of accomplishments helps students maintain motivation and can serve as a guide for moving forward. Try posting a progress tracker so that students will have a visual reminder of all the good work they’ve done. The tracker can include topics that have been tackled, questions that have been asked, and answers that have been discovered. Ask students to discuss what questions remain and how you might go about finding out those answers together.

Narrator: Building a routine that gets students in the habit of using their resources makes them more independent and sets them up for future success, and if the resources are student-generated, that’s even better. Think about themes that carry through multiple units—like scientific practices, for example—and ask students to brainstorm. Have them collect their ideas on an anchor chart, and post it in your room. As you move to subsequent units, direct students back to those resources to help them figure out new challenges. Over time, they’ll become more self-sufficient and look to find answers themselves before asking you for help when they need support.

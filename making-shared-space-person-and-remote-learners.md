When her school went fully remote, Cathleen Beachboard—an eighth-grade English teacher in Fauquier County, Virginia—noticed some of her students struggling with connectivity issues. Google Meet and Zoom used up a lot of bandwidth. The call-in feature presented an optimal alternative, though she still needed her students to see what she was doing in class.

Using Google Slides, Beachboard created a digital desk for each student in her virtual classroom because she “needed a place where we can all be together.” “I found that if a student had dial-up or they had a hot spot with a data allowance, I could keep that data use minimal if I would post the link to today’s digital classroom and then had them call in using a phone,” she says. This technique used minimal internet, and the kids were still able to communicate with each other, hear Beachboard, and see what was happening in class without having to use up all of their data. Each desk is decorated with images that students find online to express themselves.

When using breakout rooms, Beachboard pairs students together who have shared interests based on their digital desk decorations, which helps build relationships between them despite the fact that they cannot all be together in person. She encourages students to help each other if they see another classmate struggling, promoting a sense of community and camaraderie in her classroom. “We can all be on at the same time,” Beachboard says.

“And I can look at it, my students can look at it, they can look at each other’s digital desks and collaborate. It connects students who are completely virtual and the kids who are here in-person. So they still are in the same classroom.” When her school returns to fully in-person instruction, Beachboard says she still plans on utilizing digital desks.

“Digital desks are like a record book of everything that took place in class,” she explains. “If I have a student who was absent… usually absent students would really struggle. With digital desks, they’re able to look at the activities that took place and see what different groups did to really understand what happened.” Beachboard has made an editable version of the digital desk slides available for other educators to use (requires Google sign-in to make a copy).

## Transcript

Cathleen: All right, there we go. Everybody’s popping in. Ready to do this? Okay. The multiple transitions that have taken place this year have impacted all of my students. We started off the year virtual, as one giant class. And then when we came back hybrid, they were split apart.

Keelin: It has been a lot harder to connect with my teacher and other students. I’m not seeing most of them in person anymore.

Cathleen: I really needed something to connect students who are completely virtual and the kids who are here in person, and to create more normalcy throughout this entire pandemic. Kids really need their own space that is authentically theirs. I am represented in my classroom, no matter where the classroom is, and that’s the reasons digital desks came into being. There you go guys, the link is in the chat. I’m going to present now, then we’ll go over the warmup. I wanted something simple, and so I created a Google Slides deck where each student has their own individual desk, and the teacher has a board. The students go into the desk, they personalize them. You make a copy of it every day before they start writing on it. All right, so the warmup for today, I want you to go to your desk, pick a favorite childhood memory and use at least one example of figurative language in your warmup.

Keelin: It’s really helped us connect, because it’s like we’re all in the same classroom, even though we’re not. We can see everybody working live right there. You just click on someone’s desk and you can see them typing.

Cathleen: Google Slides has this great feature, where you can look at all your slides at once. And so I zoom out to this aerial view of my classroom, and all the kids are at their own desk, doing whatever it is they’re doing, but I can see all of them working at once. Oh wow, first travel soccer team, Lily. Ooh, Xavier, that is an awesome simile that you threw in there. Yeah, if you want to see some awesome writing, you check out Xavier’s desk. And as I see them work, I can see when problems arise. The students have this color-coded system. Green means, I’m good. Red means, I need 911 help, pop into my slide right now. It’s kind of like a classroom where you see a kid raise their hand. Now go to someone else’s desk and leave them feedback. Using the comment tool, you’re going to highlight something.

Owen: After the warmup, we went to other students’ desks and we left a glow and a grow.

Cathleen: Love the feedback you’re giving each other. You guys are doing awesome. Now, here’s what I want you to do. We’re going to get with partners. If you go up and you look at the board, Nathan and D’lilah are going to be partners at Nathan’s desk. The biggest surprise from utilizing digital desks is, students are becoming more confident in their writing. At first, they were a little bit scared, because they knew, everyone else can see what I’m doing. But because of that, it makes them put their best selves forward. Getting some good lines, some good hyperboles. Because kids are expressing themselves, they have a space that’s theirs, my students are thriving and engaging with each other and so now you’ll see kids going to other kids’ desks and just saying, “Hey, great job on this,” or leaving another kid a note. I want you to read the poems. The one you liked the best, put the name of the person who you think should win in the chat, and then you can peace out cub scouts and I love you guys. It’s kept my students together. They’ll have a place that’s theirs no matter where we are. Bye guys, have a great weekend.

## Transcript

Narrator: There is a lot of emphasis on routines in elementary school classrooms, and the benefits that clear expectations and communication can bring are evident. In middle school, teachers often only see students for one class period, but the same principles apply, and being really explicit about practices and procedures can help students thrive from day one throughout the entire year.

Narrator: A clean and organized environment is the first step to priming students’ brains for learning. Creating a calm classroom free of unnecessary distractions can help support focus. Keep surfaces clutter-free, and store supplies in labeled bins. Building in cleanup time will help keep things orderly, not to mention save time and instill a sense of responsibility in your students. Alternative lighting, mood music, and elements from nature—think plants—can go a long way in making a classroom a place where students want to be.

Narrator: When students have a clear idea of how to act in a situation, their brains are freed up to focus on what they are learning, so it’s important to take the guesswork out as much as possible, even if it means establishing directions for things that seem simple or obvious. From day one, be direct about how the most common routines should play out. How do you want students to enter class? Where should they store their belongings? How should they turn in assignments or access supplies? Post the steps for the most frequently used procedures on your classroom walls, and take time in the first few weeks of school to review and practice them together. As a class, developing and signing a contract that addresses behavior expectations, as well as what happens when they are not met, will help everyone be on the same page.

Narrator: There is a lot you can do in your own classroom to build routine and structure, and if you are able to get other teachers on board, everyone benefits. If possible, collaborate with fellow teachers to make routines consistent from class to class. Sharing ideas and approaches will help you identify the most effective ones and will go a long way in making day-to-day operations smooth for students. Talk with colleagues about how to manage transitions to reduce student anxiety and foster familiarity. By working as a team, you’ll build a cohesive learning experience for your students that will make them feel valued, supported, and ready to learn.

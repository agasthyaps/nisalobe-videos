Considering joining TikTok as a teacher? You won’t be alone. Claudine James and Winnie Sloan are only two of thousands of adults making the leap to the popular video platform.

In less than two years, the number of adults using TikTok has grown almost six times: from 2.6 million users to 14.3 million users. Teachers say TikTok helps them “meet students where they are,” while offering numerous benefits to learning.

## Transcript

Claudine James: Any time you use the word myself, the sentence has to start with I.

Teacher: Whatever you do to the left, you got to do it to the right.

Teacher: And then opposite elbow to opposite knee.

Claudine: I’m not a tech savvy person. At least I thought I wasn’t. But I was just at my wits’ end and trying to figure out how I could get my students more engaged in learning grammar lessons. So I realized I had to meet my students where they were, and that’s where they were, they were on TikTok.

Winnie Sloan: People are sharing themselves through TikTok, but for me personally, it’s a classroom. The sort of content you would find in my TikTok stream, number one: biology, biology, biology. It’s all about the science. TikTok makes you get it right. You only have 60 seconds to explain a concept and you’ve got to hit the main points.

Winnie: Or you get it to eight. That’s the octet rule.

Claudine: My TikTok videos provide on-the-spot remediation, not only just for my students, but for so many other people all over the world.

Claudine: Yes, I saw it from the hilltop.

Claudine: I post a new lesson every single day.

Winnie: I have found that a lot of kids, through their comments, they’re hurting out there. So you will see a lot of supportive videos, a lot of encouragement.

Winnie: Great question. Let’s compare and contrast.

Claudine: We did a TikTok on Tuesday. It has almost a million views and today is just Thursday.

Claudine: You’re welcome. Is that correct? No.

Claudine: They were, you know, calling out the answers and it’s just so engaging.

Claudine: Explain to me if tomorrow is a word and… Winnie: I have a Google doc where all my videos are curated, so you don’t have to be part of the TikTok community. You can just click on a link and you can still watch the videos.

Claudine: One of the greatest things that I’ve heard students say is, “Okay, in class, I’m kind of embarrassed and I don’t want to ask any questions. So it’s really good, when I go home and I have to the TikTok video!” Winnie: We all learn new tools, right? We can all learn new ways to connect with students. What I appreciate is it gives every student 24/7 access to me as a teacher.

Claudine: The impact I’ve seen on students is simply that they actually place value on my grammar lessons.

Claudine: Students will say “Hey, Mrs. James, don’t forget to do the grammar lesson!” And I’m like, oh, since when did we start caring about the grammar lesson, you know?

Winnie: It makes me grateful that I can help them, that I can meet that need, that I can teach it in a way that makes sense to them.

Claudine: Since I have opened my classroom to TikTok, I can honestly say that I have a classroom without walls.

Claudine: Dear followers: Thank you, no matter where you are!

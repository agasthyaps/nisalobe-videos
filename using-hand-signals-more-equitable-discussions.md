Because hand signals allow students to engage both verbally and nonverbally, conversations that use them can be more inclusive. Teachers can post the hand signals in the classroom or share them online so that students can easily refer to the visual reminder.

## Transcript

Narrator: Discussions in a physical classroom are tricky to manage, and conducting them by video adds a whole new level of complexity. Good discussions are inclusive, equitable and respectful. An agreed upon set of hand signals can reduce interruptions, allow more time to consider ideas and provide a safe space that engages all learners. A pinky and thumb extended indicates agreement with the speaker. A single index finger expresses disagreement. One fist on top of the other shows that a student wants to build on what a classmate is saying. A raised pinky finger let’s everyone know the student has a question. Making air quotes shows that a student can paraphrase a quote or concept. Students can use them to participate nonverbally, indicate when they want to speak, and how they’d like to contribute. At the beginning of every discussion, it helps to configure your screen, so your view includes as many students as possible at one time. Review the hand signals so they are fresh in everyone’s minds. Encourage students to use the signals to show they are engaged in the conversation, whether they plan to speak or not. Reinforce the importance of both speaking and listening by acknowledging nonverbal and verbal participants by name. With a little bit of practice, these hand signals can boost engagement and make for more equitable discussions, by allowing more students to participate in ways that feel comfortable for them.

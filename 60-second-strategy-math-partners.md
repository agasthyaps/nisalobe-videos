## Transcript

Teacher: Today’s problem of the day: How many pumpkins are green? Remember, you do not need to panic. You will talk with your partner. Math partners is a strategy that I use daily. I want them to be able to not only get an answer but explain how they got that answer. The first step is, they work to solve the problem on their own, and then they discuss it with a partner.

Student: So I got 8 plus 3 plus 5 equals 16.

Teacher: They have talking stems. Do I agree or disagree with you? How did you solve this, and how can you prove your answer’s correct? They will find out, hey, I did it a different way, but yet they still got the same answer. Then we come back together, and I ask for someone who feels like they can teach it to the class, because that’s what math is about. Being able to explain the steps they took to solve the problem.

Student: So then I added on 5 more and I got to 16.

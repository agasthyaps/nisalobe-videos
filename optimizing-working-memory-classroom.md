# Optimizing Working Memory in the Classroom

> Research shows that distractions, confusing material, or an overwhelming amount of information can tax a student’s working memory. Here’s how to better support this essential executive function.

Working memory is crucial to learning—providing both the cognitive space and the cognitive tools to process new thinking. If you’re looking for the research cited in the video, see the list below: Alloway and Copello’s 2013 study on the what, why, and how of working memory American Academy of Pediatrics’ 2013 report on the crucial role of recess in school Barrett et al.’s 2015 study on the impact of classroom design on learning Bui and McDaniel’s 2015 article on how outlines and diagrams can increase the effectiveness of note-taking Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation’s 2018 guide to cognitive load theory in practice Cowan’s 2014 paper on how working memory underpins cognitive development Frenda and Fenn’s 2016 article on how sleep deprivation affects working memory Gutierrez et al.’s 2019 brief on how mindfulness can improve student outcomes Harvard Center on the Developing Child’s 2014 guide to activities that enhance and practice executive function skills Immordino-Yang et al.’s 2012 paper on how the brain’s default mode is critical for development and learning Rodrigues and Pandeirada’s 2018 article on how environmental visual stimulation affects children’s cognitive performance Wang et al.’s 2020 paper on how visual cues can improve learning on instructional videos Ward et al.’s 2017 article on how the presence of smartphones can reduce available cognitive capacity

## Transcript

Working memory is where we temporarily store information we’re actively manipulating. It’s like the brain’s sketchpad, or you might think of it as a kind of mental Post-it notes. Whether we’re contemplating new information, actively solving complex problems, or following directions, working memory provides both the cognitive space and the cognitive tools to process new thinking. But working memory is also a finite resource that competes with other brain systems, and it can be pulled offline when a student is distracted, anxious, or simply trying to learn too much, too fast. So if working memory is crucial to learning, how do you optimize it in your classroom? Try starting new lessons by connecting the topic to prior knowledge. Scaffolding unfamiliar material with familiar material reduces uncertainty, freeing working memory to operate more efficiently. Avoid overwhelming students with too many ideas at once. Break lessons down into manageable pieces, and make sure all students have a chance to keep up. To safeguard working memory, reduce loud or repetitive noises, make sure classroom decorations aren’t too busy, and evaluate the environment for any other sensory distractions. A special note on cell phones: A 2017 study found that working memory is compromised by the mere presence of your cell phone, even when you turn it off or ignore it. Put it in a separate room— as far away as you can—to preserve your cognitive focus. The more students have to keep track of, the less cognitive capacity is available to solve complex problems. So provide scaffolds, write down or record key information, consider anchor charts, and use clear verbal and visual cues to reduce cognitive friction and guide students’ attention during a lesson. Finally, don’t forget, brain breaks are mental hygiene. Weave in activities like exercising, recess, meditation, and even daydreaming or sleep to allow students to clear working memory, reset their focus, and jump into a new lesson re-energized.

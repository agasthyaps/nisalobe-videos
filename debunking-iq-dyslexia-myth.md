## Transcript

Narrator: Children with dyslexia who struggle to read often conclude they’re not smart enough to understand the material. But the research says that’s wrong. For typically developing children, IQ and reading ability are linked. According to a 2010 study, they track together over time, and mutually reenforce one another. But for children with dyslexia, a gap between IQ and reading ability appears in the early grades and then widens over time. Dyslexia, it turns out, can be deceptive. Children with the condition often struggle with reading, but it’s a mistake to connect that to intelligence. They are just as bright as other students and every bit as capable of mastering the material. So, be sure to be patient and encouraging with your students with dyslexia. Remember, it’s not a race. And try to offer them a range of tools like audiobooks, visual aids, text-to-speech apps, or videos. Finally, don’t define them by their disability; focus on their strengths instead.

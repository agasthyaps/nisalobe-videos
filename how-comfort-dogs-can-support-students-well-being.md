“I had no idea what a comfort dog was,” says Maspeth High School assistant principal Jesse Pachter. “I thought a comfort dog was going to be walking around the school the entire time and allowing students to pet them. That is actually the complete opposite of what a comfort dog is.

A comfort dog is going to be utilized in specific settings, as a targeted intervention.” Since completing training required by New York City’s Department of Education, Eli the comfort dog has been coming to Maspeth three days a week, along with his owner, school social worker David Blauner. Eli assists students in a variety of settings—from one-on-one and group counseling sessions to help students combat anxiety, to obstacle course training to help students with communication disorders work through their own social and academic challenges. Blauner refers to Eli as a “rapport accelerator.” His presence helps students feel more relaxed and open up sooner if they are dealing with issues at home or in school.

Eli also helps break down the stigma of going to see a school counselor. “If I do ever have any issues,” says one student, “I would go to him [Mr. Blauner].” Says Pachter, “We have seen students’ attendance improve, solely because they know Eli is going to be here.” To learn more about the comfort dog program at Maspeth, read Jesse Pachter’s Edutopia article, “ 3 Benefits of Having a Comfort Dog in School .” Find information about comfort dogs at the elementary level in Laura Wheeler’s Edutopia article, “ 4 Legged SEL: How to Start a Therapy Dog Program. ”

## Transcript

David Blauner: Go, go, go. Good job!

Blauner: Having Eli become part of our school is my most proud professional achievement. I knew that when I adopted him that he would have a profound impact on my family. But I did not know that he would have that same type of impact on our school community.

Blauner: Hey guys, how are you?

Students: [Chattering excitedly.] Blauner: Hey, guys.

Jesse Pachter: The Maspeth High School’s goal is to make sure that our students feel comfortable, safe and supported as soon as they walk through the door. So, one of our main things are focusing on relationships.

Blauner: Eli’s a comfort dog. He’s here to support our Guidance Department.

Blauner: C’mon, E.

Blauner: I’ve always looked at Eli as a rapport accelerator. We have students that it takes, you know, several months for them to see me as a trusted adult in the building. If they’re comfortable with Eli, and Eli is there, that may happen that much more quickly, and that can help us to identify different challenges that those students are facing.

Pachter: Does anybody have any specific students that they feel should be referred to meeting with Eli and would benefit?

Counselor: So, I have a student that comes to visit me frequently, and oftentimes is in distress.

Pachter: So, as the Guidance Department, we come in contact with over 1,100 students. I definitely think Eli breaks down the stigma of going to a social worker, counselor.

Blauner: Good boy!

Student: Good boy!

Johanna: I feel like with Eli things are not as hard to talk about. Like I know if I’m like struggling with something, it’s a safe zone.

Blauner: I know that you have the SAT next week.

Student: Yeah.

Blauner: Big important test.

Johanna: Oh, yeah.

Blauner: So, how are you guys feeling about it?

Student: I don’t know, it’s just like very stressful, because it puts a lot of pressure on you and it’s just— Blauner: Eli helps to create that supportive environment. To know if I’m struggling to say something, I can pop a treat in Eli’s mouth. I can pet him. He can help deescalate certain students who are feeling uncomfortable, angry, anxious.

Nikola: I just like—I don’t feel confident in myself and tests like matter a lot, so… Blauner: Mm-hm, so there’s like a little bit of self-doubt combined— Nikola: Mm-hm.

Nikola: Having Eli there was very relaxing, and it helped me get my mind off of it.

Student: Eli. [Laughter.] Blauner: When you— Pachter: So, initially, I thought a comfort dog was going to be walking around the school the entire time and allowing students to pet them. It’s much more than that.

Blauner: And we’re just going to put this back here to start.

Pachter: A comfort dog is going to be utilized in specific settings to be a targeted intervention for a student that would benefit from that dog’s presence.

Jack: With Eli here, he’s more like a stress reliever for many students that are not comfortable being around a lot of people.

Blauner: Show him what’s in our hand.

Jack: Eli, come.

Blauner: There’s one and he’s still looking.

Blauner: So, in the obstacle course, it allows our students to participate in activities and interventions to increase their socialization. And allow them to feel successful in areas outside of academia.

Blauner: So, Eli’s struggling with this one, right? What can we do to help Eli feel better about these yellow buckets? He’s never seen them before.

Jack: With Eli, I find it fun helping him by going around the obstacles. It took a few tries.

Blauner: If Eli can overcome an obstacle, they must be able to overcome an obstacle.

Blauner: Let’s follow Jack’s model. Let’s try the hard barrier. And let’s try the easier barrier. OK, so there’s the first one. And keep going.

Jack: C’mon.

Blauner: And now he did both. Good job! So, how did it feel to problem-solve?

Jack: When he did it, I felt proud for him. I felt happy for him.

Blauner: Two, good job.

Jack: I appreciate having someone around that I can help or that’s helping me.

Blauner: All right. And as soon as he goes down— Pachter: I just think Eli is so unique. And we’ve seen students’ attendance improve solely because they know that Eli’s going to be here. Just his mere presence really uplifts spirits within the school.

Johanna: A lot of the people now know Mr. Blauner because of Eli. He’s always like the guy walking around with the dog. I feel like if I do ever have any issues, I would go to him.

Blauner: It’s a source of pride for our staff and our students to know that our school is going the extra mile to provide them with the best support that we possibly can.

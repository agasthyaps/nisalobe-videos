## Transcript

Teacher: Go!

Student: Go, Jay.

Karen: Young people are taking their cues from us, so social and emotional learning is not just teaching young people these skills. We’re first and foremost modeling these skills. We are being aware that how we regulate ourselves, how we demonstrate curiosity, how we approach problem solving and unpredictable moments, all of those are as important as anything that we’re going to teach in an exercise. So we have to start with the adult.

Eric: The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Green Bay is a nonprofit organization that does whatever it takes to close the opportunity gap for youth ages seven to eighteen. We currently serve five hundred students every single day in seven different locations, and work to meet whatever needs they have to help them to be successful. Our staff is at the core of what we do. They’re doing really hard, difficult work, and we know that we need to have well-regulated staff who enjoy coming to work every day, who see this as a fun place to be, and know that they’re making an impact on the youth in our community. Youth development professionals sometimes provide the longest consistent adult relationship for our members, and so we really take pride in developing our staff, in making sure that they’re equipped to meet the needs of the kids who walk through the door.

Students: Team!

Student: Yeah.

Eric: We’ve instituted team development Fridays where we close down the first Friday of every month. We bring our staff in, in a very structured way, but allowing them to have the choice to grow where they feel is most important to them, and that includes personal development and professional development.

Sandi: We have different styles of receiving and giving communication. So we can be more effective in our communications with each other if we understand a little about our similarities and then our differences as well. We like to do trainings that can help them both personally and professionally. Today the training helped people facilitate their communication. So if I can understand how I think and feel and relate and what my patterns are, that’s helpful because that self-awareness is really important.

Rey: I think it just kind of opens my eyes to who I am as a person, and then I can better understand myself, which helps me be able to understand the kids as well. It just helps me be adaptive.

Sandi: To be able to equip our staff with tools, resources, knowledge, so that they feel confident in handling situations, that obviously translates to, you know, being able to reach our kids.

Karen: So we’re looking at cultural competence, we’re looking at an understanding of child and adolescent development. We’re looking at an understanding of the broader needs that community has and how those needs are affecting young people who are coming in.

Eric: Your heart brings you here, but our reaction and the way that we support people is what’s going to keep them. We always share a meal together. There are team share outs.

Sandi: We tell stories about successes we’re having.

Caregiver: There was a young man who wasn’t eating at school because he was embarrassed because he got free lunch, and oftentimes he was just super tired, very disengaged, seven Fs. So we really just started working on like, who are you and who am I, and just talking.

Eric: The caregiver really needs to be at the center, because if they’re not in a good place, they’re not able to respond to what the kids are coming forward with.

Caregiver: He turned those even Fs into passing grades. He stops and talks to teachers and everybody’s noticed that, so really a good challenge.

Eric: Thanks, Alex, I appreciate that. <applause> Eric: I would love for our staff to realize on a daily basis, in micro moments, the impact that they’re having on the lives of other people. It will never be lost, I mean, my appreciation for the work that they do, and I will continue to drive that message so that they know that they play such an important role in the success of our kids and our families, and really our community.

## Article

At the beginning of the school year, fostering a sense of belonging is one of the most important things a teacher can do to set the stage for positive learning experiences. At The Co-op School in Brooklyn, New York, third-grade students play a game called Circle of Sameness—an easygoing, low-stakes way to build classroom community by helping them discover what they have in common with their peers so they begin to form connections. In this activity, students form a large circle.

The teacher then offers a series of statements—like “Step into the center if you have a sibling” or “…if you like to cook.” With each prompt, students who relate step into the circle, showing shared experiences and sparking moments of recognition across the group. The game can begin with simple prompts and gradually move to ones that make students feel special or reflect personal identity—like “Step into the circle if you speak more than one language” or “…if you help take care of someone.” Incorporating movement is also an option: Asking students to tiptoe, skip, or hop around the circle can break the ice a bit—and give them a chance to get some extra energy out. And while, for the most part, the game is a silent one, students can follow up with each other at a later time, with the prompts serving as topics to chat about.

“You like that too?” or “I didn’t know that about you!” set the stage for fresh conversations, new friendships, and deeper relationships. As Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene explains, “[It helps] students feel connected. They feel like they have an opening to talk to each other.

They feel they are part of a larger community and that they know new things about their peers.” Games like Circle of Sameness create a foundation for learning by making space for students to express themselves, let others know a little more about them, and learn about their new classmates. And when students feel seen and included, they’re more ready to take risks, collaborate, and thrive—throughout the year. To learn more about games that support learning, build classroom community, and develop social and emotional skills for students, check out the many articles that Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene has written for Edutopia.

## Transcript

Jocelyn Greene: Once you look around at everybody, let’s think, “I might not know everything there is to know about everybody here.” So we’ll play this game, and we can call this our circle of sameness. Come into the center circle if you took a trip this summer. Because we play circles of sameness, our students feel connected. They feel like they have an opening to talk to each other. They feel like they are part of a larger community and that they know new things about their peers. Come into the center circle if you have a younger sibling. Games are an awesome way for kids to get to know each other at the start of the year and for teachers to get to know their students. Walk into the center circle if you have an older sibling. Circle of Sameness is a game where you come together with other people when you hear a cue based on what you identify with. Everybody take your toes and find a spot. So we had the outside circle, and then I invited kids to come into the circle if the statement applied to them. You can play around with the way you move in the circle. And last, just do a little hops. So that it just gets kids into their bodies. Come into the center if you like to play video games. You can start with something simple. Come into the center if you like to cook. And then things that might make kids feel special. Now come into the center if you speak more than one language.

Student: Oh, me.

Student: Yep, me.

Jocelyn Greene: OK. The students don’t have the opportunity to follow up right then and there, so they’re left with a sense of, “I’m curious.” Come into the center if you in your life have taken care of someone else. And you can invite them to have that kind of discussion a little later. It’s like you’re planting the seeds for conversation.

Student: I took good care of my siblings and my cat.

Student: I didn’t know you had a cat, but I take care of my sister.

Student: I’ve taken care of my friend.

Jocelyn Greene: The benefit of get-to-know-you games is that you’ve carved out space for kids to be free to express themselves and to find each other through connection.

Student: I’ve taken care of my baby sister.

Jocelyn Greene: And they feel like they’re part of a larger family, which is their school.

## Transcript

Teacher: Front table shout-outs.

Student: I have a shout out for Annalia. She got to work really fast.

Teacher: A shout-out is a positive comment given from one peer to another. Shout-outs are such an effective strategy for anyone, and you can throw them in anywhere. They’re easy, they’re quick. The first thing is a ding on my little chime, which gets everyone’s attention. Good, I see almost everybody. I will ask each group to give a shout-out to someone that they noticed was doing a particularly good job, or doing something that was difficult for them.

Student: I have a shout-out for Deanelis, because she was working really hard on her chicken.

Teacher: Awesome, awesome. It’s not just me as the teacher saying, “You’re doing well.” It’s a way for them to interact with each other and celebrate positivity. We notice, we focus on the things that are going well.

Student: I have a shout-out to Jeremiah, because he was reading good.

Teacher: Yeah.

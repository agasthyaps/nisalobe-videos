## Transcript

Teacher: Great job, okay.

Student: Thank you.

Teacher: Let me know if I can help more. Catherine and Tyson, you’re up next. So the teacher queue is on the white board. It’s a place where students can sign up when they need help from me, and it’s a way for me to keep organized when they’re doing group work. At the beginning of each class, I write teacher queue, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then when students need help, they sign their name. When I see that a student has signed up on the queue, I go and meet with them. You go down and then have another one going down this way. And when I’m done helping them, I go back to the queue, erase the student’s name who I’ve helped, and go to the next person. And then just make sure you’re going on the inside of the line. I always feel a lot of anxiety if I don’t have a queue. The queue makes things really fair. I don’t have to manage who needs help when. I can just focus on meeting with students. I think it’s actually going to work better if there’s a force applied across this entire piece.

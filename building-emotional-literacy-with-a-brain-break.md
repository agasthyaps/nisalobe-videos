Brain breaks provide an excellent opportunity for students to get their wiggles out, but some of them can also double as lessons in social and emotional learning (SEL). In Sammi Priti’s first-grade classroom at Arts and Letters United 305 in Brooklyn, New York, guest teacher and Child’s Play NY founder Jocelyn Greene leads the students in a game called Pass the Hello. To play, students circle up and select three different emotions: excited, bored, and frustrated, for example.

Starting with the first one, each student turns to the classmate next to them and passes the word “hello” along, using facial expressions, body language, and the way they choose say the word aloud to convey the designated feeling. After everyone has had a turn, the class starts again with the next emotion. This activity not only helps students release energy but also builds emotional literacy by encouraging them to explore and articulate a range of feelings.

To strengthen social connections and trust within the group, Greene suggests varying the circle’s direction or having students switch places to interact with different classmates in each round. The simple but impactful game allows students to take ownership of their emotional expression—and connect with their peers in a playful way—while developing their overall social and emotional skill set. Especially in preschool and early elementary, teaching students to label and express their emotions helps them establish a foundational skill that enables them to better understand and verbalize how they are feeling.

This emotional fluency is crucial for young learners, as it sets the stage for them to communicate more effectively, navigate social interactions with greater empathy and awareness, and ultimately regulate themselves better. Child’s Play NY works with schools across New York City to help teachers realize the many benefits of theater games in the classroom—more student voice and choice, stronger classroom community, and deeper curriculum connections.

## Transcript

Jocelyn Greene : Everybody, repeat after me. One, two, three. Students : Hello. Greene : I love using theater games for brain breaks because they’re physical. You’re going to play a game with this now. And so kids can end up getting their wiggles out and they’re also getting that incredible social-emotional learning. Let’s take one big step back, everybody. Pass the Hello is a lovely game where you can just literally say the word “hello.” Students : Hello! Greene : And then introduce a few different emotions. You can get those suggestions from your kids. So maybe they’re going to say it bored or they’re going to say it excited or they’re going to say it mad. Now I’m going to pass a hello to my friend over here. Ready for our excited hello. Hello. Student : Hello! Greene : Then, one at a time, they’re going to just pass that hello around the circle and they’re going to feel that ownership over how they themselves said that hello. Student : Hello. Student 2 : Hello! Greene : And it comes right back around to the first person who started it and then the emotion changes again. Everybody give yourselves a round of applause. And you can have the kids find a new circle spot so they’re standing next to somebody else or you can simply just change the direction. This way so it’s a different direction. And that gives kids a different person to connect with at each time. Here we go. Everybody’s frustrated at hello. Is it going to be different? Let’s see how it goes. Greene : Certainly just the idea of becoming more fluent with emotion vocabulary. Student : Arghh! Greene : This is how I am when I feel frustrated. Labeling emotions is just such a great foundational skill for young people because once kids know more names for what they’re feeling, they’re more able to articulate those emotions.

## Article

When researchers used neural imaging technology on students and teachers as they learned together, they caught a fascinating glimpse of how brains can converge around a shared understanding. What’s the practical takeaway? Stronger “brain synchrony” between peers—and between students and teachers—predicted better academic performance on follow-up tests, underscoring the importance of expertise and the role of direct instruction, while also suggesting potential for more value from peer-to-peer and social learning.

## Transcript

Narrator : In 2021, we reported on a study that showed that the brains of college students and their teachers looked remarkably similar as they progressed through a computer science course. According to brain scans conducted as students watched lecture videos, the brain activity amongst those who understood the material gradually aligned with other high-performing students, their teachers, and with experts in the field, a kind of brain synchrony that suggested the emergence of a common understanding. For students who failed to grasp the material, though, the brain activity never quite got on track. Those students were drifting. A 2023 study using EEG, which measures electrical activity in the brain, largely confirms those findings. High school science teachers taught groups of young adults fitted with electrodes about science topics such as bipedalism, habitats, and lipids. Researchers found that similar brain activity between peers and between students and teachers predicted better academic performance on follow-up tests. Taken together, the research underscores the importance of scholarly expertise and direct instruction, but also hints at the downstream power of peer-to-peer and social learning. As knowledge passes from teachers to learners to greater and lesser degrees, some students understand material quickly, others more slowly, an opportunity to distribute the work of learning emerges. By pairing advanced students with struggling peers, always assisted by nudges from the teacher, groups of students might discuss and converge around an accurate, shared interpretation of the material.

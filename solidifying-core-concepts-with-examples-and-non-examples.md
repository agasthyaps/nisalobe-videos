# Solidifying Core Concepts With Examples and Non-Examples

> Asking students to identify an example of what something is—and what it isn’t—deepens clarity and leaves little room for misconception.

## Article

In Sarah Yuska’s sixth-grade science class at Monocacy Middle School in Frederick, Maryland, students are just finishing up learning about body systems—respiratory, circulatory, skeletal, and so on. Next, they’ll tackle how the systems work together in an organism. But before moving on, Yuska wants to be sure her students have a solid understanding of each individual system.

Enter examples and non-examples, a research-backed approach that helps students refine their own mental models of concepts—and helps teachers identify any misunderstandings in key foundational ideas. According to Learning Science Partners cofounder Jim Heal, “If you have faulty understanding at the outset, it’s just going to compound over time. And so with an example and a non-example, you are inviting students to be able to say, ‘I know what this idea is because I can compare it to what it isn’t .’” In the classroom, Yuska distributes posters, each with four headings: Respiratory, Circulatory, Both, and None.

She also passes out cards containing pictures of different cells, organs, and people doing activities that would connect to those systems. The sorting begins. Working in pairs, students have to determine what category each card belongs in, and the discussion among students is powerful.

“I was happy to see they were using their resources,” says Yuska. “I noticed the children were really trying to work out where the cards belonged and why they belong there. And then I heard some nice disagreements.” While walking around the room observing, Yuska is able to see where students may have some misunderstandings, and she ends class by using the overhead projector and sorting the cards as a whole class, so everyone can not only see where each card belongs but also hear the reasoning behind the categorization.

The activity can be applied to almost any topic that lends itself to a classification exercise—from geometric shapes to branches of government to literary devices. Having strong, clear examples and non-examples chosen ahead of time—and course-correcting along the way—is critical to the success of the activity. For teachers trying it out, Deans for Impact has published a PDF called “ Using Examples and Non-Examples ” that describes how to do the activity, shares why it works, and lists common pitfalls to avoid.

Why is identifying examples and non-examples a strong way to solidify core content? Knowledge is organized in long-term memory as mental models called schema, and this type of activity helps create accurate and nuanced schema—which is incredibly important for students who must draw upon those concepts for future learning. This video is part of our How Learning Happens series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Sarah Yuska: Why is it important that we understand examples and non-examples?

Jim Heal: When you want students to understand what makes a certain thing what it is, you can’t allow for any sort of misunderstanding to creep in, particularly if they’re gonna rely on that further on in the arc of learning.

Sarah Yuska: Now we’re gonna do examples and non-examples of some body systems.

Jim Heal: If you have faulty understanding at the outset, it’s just going to compound over time. And so with an example and a non-example, you are inviting students to be able to say, “I know what this idea is because I can compare it to what it isn’t.” Sarah Yuska: If we truly understand the topic we’re learning, you will know what is an example and what is a non-example. We’re in our last unit on body systems. We’ve just finished going through the six organ systems that we’re learning, and now we’re starting to really break down and understand how they work together. We’re going to do a card sort. The activity we did today was an example, non-example lesson. My goal in doing this activity was to have them think a little bit more deeply about what is in the system and what isn’t in the system, because if they can separate those two, I know that they’ve already got a good foundation. You have your cards and you have your poster. You may start. I passed out the sorting cards as well as posters that I created, and then I paired the students up with their cards, and they started their discussions in sorting, and I said, “Be prepared to defend your choices.” Student: These are kidneys, so that’s in excretory. Student 2: Yeah.

Sarah Yuska: On the cards we had pictures of different cells, pictures of organs, pictures of people doing activities that would connect to that system. Do you agree that they belong in a non-example of a digestive and muscular system? Student 2: Yeah, because they have to get plant cells.

Sarah Yuska: Correct. We do not have plant cells in our body. This was not a final wrap-up assessment for this unit. We’re still in the learning process. I was happy to see they were using their resources. I noticed the children were having really good discussions between them, saying, “No, I think this actually… those cells don’t belong there. Those cells belong over here.” They were really trying to work out where the cards belonged and why they belonged there. And then I heard some nice disagreements. Do you agree that it is both the circulatory and respiratory?

Student: Um, no. Well, it has the lungs. Yeah, which is in the respiratory system.

Sarah Yuska: Uhhuh. Yeah. I did circulate around the room. And then that kind of led me to think, “OK, I see some of their misconceptions. I see some of their understanding. So I’m going to take all of the cards for all of the systems…” And I used the overhead projector to show the two system names. And then from there, I would say, “OK, guys, what do you think? Where does this belong?” Is this an example of either one of those systems?

Student: No.

Sarah Yuska: No. Why? What is this?

Student: Skeletal.

Sarah Yuska: Skeletal. OK, I’m gonna put that… I let then the students share out their thoughts. You think it’s the nervous system?

Student: Yeah.

Sarah Yuska: Why, Maddy?

Student: Because when, um, if you were like to touch like a hot pan, your brain would give your hand the signal to pull away.

Sarah Yuska: All right.

Jim Heal: Examples and non-examples are best used when you want to make absolutely sure that the conceptual understanding is built on a very solid foundation. And in playing both sides of examples and non-examples, you get richer, uh, manifestations of the idea that you want students to engage in.

Sarah Yuska: Good. How’d we do on that one?

Student: Good.

Sarah Yuska: All right. Carefully put away your cards.

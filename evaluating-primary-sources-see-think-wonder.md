# Evaluating Primary Sources Through a See, Think, Wonder

> By taking the time to observe, infer, and ask great questions about historical artifacts and images, students avoid jumping to conclusions.

## Article

When seventh-grade students arrive at Meredith Howard’s class at Albert Hill Middle School in Richmond, Virginia, there’s one thing they always know to expect: They’ll pick up a See, Think, Wonder worksheet and take it to their desk. What don’t they know? Which document, photo, political cartoon, or other primary source they’ll see on the worksheet.

That’s when they have to draw on their skills to observe, infer, and question the source. This daily activity gets students’ brains working—before the bell even rings. Howard selects primary sources that connect to the current unit.

Students are given a few minutes to work independently, or to confer with table mates, to look closely at the source. They first see , noting the details of who/what/when/where that can be observed without bias. Then they think , making inferences about what the source might represent, who may have authored it, and who the audience is.

Finally, they wonder , asking questions about what they’d like to learn about the source and how it connects to the history they’re studying. After the students work independently, Howard leads the class in a discussion. At this point, the students switch to a pencil, pen, or marker with a different color.

Howard asks for student contributions, always following up with more detailed questions: Where do you see that? How do you know? Is that an observation or an inference?

She projects her own copy of the source and demonstrates how she fills out the worksheet—including making notes on the source itself. The students follow along, adding and correcting in the different color. At the end of the week, Howard asks students to turn in one of the See, Think, Wonder worksheets from that week, and she grades them on completeness.

For her, the value in this activity is not assessment but rather fostering skills in media literacy. As students encounter information from an increasingly fractured media environment, she sees it as more important than ever that students learn to slow down and evaluate sources, and ask tough questions about their trustworthiness. See, Think, Wonder is one of the routines developed to help make thinking visible by Project Zero at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education.

To explore this activity and one other thinking routine from Project Zero more deeply, read Jorge Valenzuela’s article for Edutopia titled “ Boosting Critical Thinking Across the Curriculum .”

## Transcript

Meredith Howard: What is something, if you were looking at this poster, it’s not written outright, but you can infer that, “Ah, I’m meant to look at this and feel this way or think this thing?” Because we do See, Think, Wonder in my class, I see that students are able to engage more deeply with primary sources and secondary sources that we encounter in the course of a lesson. What emotion is this propaganda poster making you feel?

Students: Patriotism.

Meredith Howard: Patriotism is a great answer. Good. I start my class with a See, Think, Wonder. I want students to come in and immediately be engaged by something they see on the screen or immediately be like, “Well, what is this?” And so, it’s an attention grabber, for sure. I’m going to give us about four minutes. Three things you see, two things you can infer from your observations, and at least one question.

Warren: The first thing you want to do is know what it actually is. You got to look at the captioning and then that’s when you start looking at what’s actually in the photograph or picture. It’s helpful to me because it just starts my brain up at the start of class.

Meredith Howard: In history, it’s particularly well-suited because that is the time where I really have my students engage with primary sources that are related to the content I’m teaching. Some of them are funny, some of them are upsetting. It always gives you some kind of reaction.

Gabby: I feel like it helps us get a better understanding of the topic by trying to get there ourselves and figure it out ourselves. I feel like we’re learning more.

Meredith Howard: So, this is a World War I propaganda poster. OK, now we know what it is. What do you see? There’s a lot to unpack. Gwen.

Gwen: The title is, “If You Can’t Enlist, Invest.” Meredith Howard: What I’m asking my students to do is to see. Without any biases, just look deeply. Because a lot of times, we’ll jump to our inferences, but those will be wrong, especially if we’re not looking deeply. What is he fighting? I’m going to write down the source now. You should write down the source, too. Will.

Will: Devastation. It’s like in the bottom left.

Meredith Howard: A lot of times, I will see things for the first time for sources that I have been very familiar with. Suddenly, “Oh, you’re right.” Blake found it. Literally, I’ve looked at this for many years. I know what it is now.

Students: Whoa. It’s an old lady.

Meredith Howard: Yes. That’s her hand, right? So, we’ve got a witch who is representing what?

Will: Devastation.

Meredith Howard: Devastation. All right, inferences. “If you can’t enlist, invest.” So who is the audience? Because propaganda is never random.

Students: Maybe women.

Meredith Howard: Women, good. If you start your sentence in your brain with, “I think that’s…” That’s an inference because you’ve already moved on from observing. You are using your observations to now give yourself a truth that you think is present in the source. All right? Now, what the heck is a Liberty Bond?

Students: Aren’t bonds like you give the government or a corporation money and then they pay you later?

Meredith Howard: Very good. I want them to start making inferences and see where their knowledge gaps are. If they truly were a historian, they would engage in that. And then the next step is to, “What do I not know?” Questions? Even if it’s already been answered, what do you wonder now about this source? What would be something that would need additional research? Ruby.

Ruby: Who made it?

Meredith Howard: Who made this poster? We need to know who the author is as often as possible.

Warren: This is the whole reason why we do history, just to help us in our day-to-day life understand why things are and their trustworthiness.

Meredith Howard: Too often, in our interactions with media, we are quick to judge. I’m preparing them for citizenship and digital media literacy, that skill of saying, “Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that backed up by the observations? Is there something else here you might be missing that could give you a fuller picture?” How many of you, this would’ve persuaded you? Yeah?

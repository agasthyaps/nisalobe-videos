## Transcript

Narrator: Remember personal space? Family time? Peace and quiet? According to new research, technology is gradually encroaching on these sanctuaries, blurring the line between work and play, depriving us of essential opportunities to recharge and replacing downtime with a relentless, always on culture. For teacher, the collision of invasive new technologies with the obligations of a global pandemic have pushed things to a breaking point. Required to master new tech without adequate support and training, educators now log up to 20 hours a week preparing digital lesson plans while battling nagging feelings of incompetence and desperation. Meanwhile, an average of 100 emails a day pile up in their inboxes, often after work hours, and the pressure to reply can feel irresistible. It adds up to chronic exhaustion and spills over into strained relationships and even physical ailments like headaches, sleep disruption and high blood pressure. The issues demand immediate changes to school policy. Adopt policies that encourage an end to all work-related communication after school hours except during emergencies. When in doubt, don’t adopt new tools at all. Add them only when they’re truly useful and there’s a comprehensive training plan in place. Conduct work-life balance surveys to gauge staff wellbeing. Ask questions directly related to work-life balance. Hire help for data entry and other virtual paperwork which is a poor use of a teacher’s time. And finally, paying lip service is demoralizing. Technology is a valuable tool but enforceable policies that limit its sphere of influence should be a school priority.

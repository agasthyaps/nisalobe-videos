## Transcript

Teacher: If we could all practice our respect and friendship and SLANT on this way. Our school uses SLANT as a tool to help enable students to have productive and meaningful discussions. We want to make sure that people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts in this classroom. They have to sit up. They have to lean in. They’re acknowledging the speaker. They’re nodding, and they’re tracking the speaker, and that’s something that is expected of students. So I’m going to have you practice showing friendship and respect with your bodies right now. SLANTing is when students understand that that’s how they are going to give their full attention. I want you both to come stand up here. So I’m going to ask that we SLANT. When you’re talking, you’re being vulnerable and it’s a big difference when they give you their full attention. It’s a great way to teach what it looks like to respect somebody.

## Article

In a positive behavioral intervention system (PBIS) classroom, the paper tickets many teachers give out to reinforce students’ behavior can become cumbersome and difficult to track. Second-grade teacher Johanna Cleary at Whiting Lane Elementary School in West Hartford, Connecticut, has found a handy solution: She uses a 10-star punch card for each student instead. She’s made her management much more efficient—and just as effective (and fun!) for the kids, who can turn in their completed punch cards for low- or no-cost rewards like extra Lego time, stuffed animal day, the chance to wear slippers to school, a respite in the classroom mindful corner, and the opportunity to bring in a guest reader.

“It’s important to really know your kids and what motivates them,” says Cleary. “I love being able to keep things playful in elementary school and just make the learning space a fun and motivating place to be.”

Johanna Cleary : So I’m going to give you guys each a star punch at this group for working together and following the directions given. As part of our school’s positive behavior intervention and support system, I started using a punch card for my kids to help them keep accountable. We used to have a system schoolwide where students were given lots of little blue tickets throughout the day. They would have to keep track of them throughout the week. And it was a lot to keep track of. Please put your scissors down. I really wanted to streamline things a bit, so we created the punch card system. All right, my friends, please work with your groups. The cards I made on colored cardstock put a little hole punch in them, and they hang on their desks. It has circles at the bottom, numbers 1 through 10. And throughout the day, I’ll let the kids verbally know what I see that they have done that’s above and beyond expectation. Nice work, Jacob. And I give them a little star punch on a number, and when they reach 10, they can cash it in for one of our set rewards that we have posted in the classroom. Some of the favorites are stuffed animal day. They get to bring a stuffed animal to school. We have Winslow the donkey from a story that we read, and they can have that for the day. Are you enjoying your day with Winslow? Is he learning a lot from your group work today? Slippers for the day, Lego time, drawing time, homework pass, day in the mindful corner. At the end of the day is when they cash everything in. So when we’re doing pack-up time, kids come with their cards. They know they can tell me which coupon that they want or prize box. I think it’s important to really know your kids and what really motivates them. I love being able to keep things playful in elementary school and just make the learning space a fun and motivating place to be. So simple things, they don’t have to cost money. Charlotte, I love the way you gave me listening ears there—awesome job. My students have really been able to own and see their choices and growth within the classroom. They like to collect their finished cards and take them home and share it with their parents. So it’s a great home-school connection for parents to see the good choices that their kids are making at school as well. You are getting close to a reward. I wonder if it’ll happen today or later this week.

In Brooklyn, New York, eighth-grade teacher Paloma Blandon emphasizes the importance of her students at The Co-op School not only grasping essential concepts, but also having the public speaking skills to be able to share them. “In all of their classes, they are expected not only to understand the material, but be able to express it to someone else or to each other,” Blandon says. “They’re often presenting, and so learning how to communicate ideas effectively, and in an engaging manner for an audience, is so important.” That’s where actor and theater teacher Jocelyn Greene of Child’s Play NY comes in.

By leading a workshop that shares some of the technical skills that actors employ onstage, she is able to help the middle school class strengthen their ability to articulate their ideas and feel more confident when presenting. “A simple technical adjustment—an actor’s tip about how to speak publicly—and their voices automatically become much more present and their ideas become much more cogent,” says Greene. As Greene works through a series of scenarios and low-stakes exchanges, she asks the students to reframe their jitters as a signal that they are about to embark on something new.

By acknowledging nervousness, incorporating breathing exercises, and applauding their bravery, the students begin to feel more centered and prepared to share with a group. Additional exercises help students tune in to the volume of their voices, their body language, and their intonation. By the end of the workshop, students practice using a reading they are all familiar with: Puck’s monologue from A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

The performances receive feedback (and applause!) from classmates. As Blandon observed, “It was really amazing to see them improve. By the second and third time of them expressing the same idea, they were doing so with fewer filler words, more clarity, and more confidence.” For more tips on supporting students in developing public speaking skills, see Jocelyn Greene’s article for Edutopia, “ 7 Ways to Help Young Students Speak With Confidence and Poise .”

## Transcript

Jocelyn Greene: So these are the two things to think about. Punctuation, breathe. All right, take it away.

Student: My gentle Puck come hither.

Jocelyn Greene: By explicitly teaching public speaking skills, we help our students grow into their most powerful potential. Let’s imagine… A simple technical adjustment, in this case, an actor’s tip about how to speak publicly, and their voices automatically become much more present and their ideas become much more cogent.

Student: My gentle Puck come hither.

Paloma Blandon: One of the most important skills that I’m trying to teach to my students is to express themselves. In all of their classes, they are expected not only to understand the material, but be able to express it. So learning how to communicate your ideas effectively is so important.

Jocelyn Greene: Very good. That was great. Today I led a workshop on public speaking for the eighth grade. These kids have great ideas, and sometimes they just are lacking some of those technical skills that actors have, and so the point of the workshop was to sort of give them those skills and then see how they flourished. Think about something you would enjoy telling someone else about. First, I asked them to imagine they were about to step on a stage and publicly speak and what would happen to their bodies. What does getting nervous do to our body?

Student: Chills.

Jocelyn Greene: Chills. OK, great.

Student: Your hands could get sweaty or clammy.

Jocelyn Greene: And then I help them think about how can we reframe that, just even as a mental exercise. Instead of saying, “I’m so nervous,” we can think, “I am so brave.” And that little switch can help these kids sort of step into some sort of courage rather than being nervous. What happens to your breath? None of you talked about breath. And we actually modeled and demonstrated how not to breathe. And just sort of re-centering that to be coming from a lower place in our body will give us more energy and more calm.

Student: My favorite shows.

Jocelyn Greene: We talked about how when we get nervous, we often shift our weight back and forth. You will actually have a lot more focus if you have that planted feeling at your feet. Pretend that you are anchored on the ground through these amazing tree roots. And people will take your ideas more seriously too if you’re not sort of shifting around. I had them imagine this idea of being on a playground and trying to reach somebody with your volume.

Student: The means of production.

Jocelyn Greene: We just automatically come out more authoritative and more confident by using a bigger voice.

Student: And you also have to get some red peppers so that way you can have cold protection.

Paloma Blandon: It was amazing to watch how students opened up throughout the process of trying something, receiving feedback, and then trying it again.

Jocelyn Greene: Amazing. I’m going to pause you there because that was so good. So then it came time to actually put this into action with text. Think of this as sort of a way to do public speaking through Shakespeare. And so I brought in the Puck monologue from the Midsummer Night’s Dream as an example of this character who’s just at the end of the play making a speech to the audience.

Student: That you have but slumbered here, while these visions did appear.

Jocelyn Greene: Those same skill sets they can use when they are in a college interview or presenting an idea before peers.

Student: That the rude sea grew civil at her song.

Paloma Blandon: It was really amazing to see them improve in their public speaking skills. By the second and third time of them expressing the same idea, they were doing so with fewer filler words, more clarity, and more confidence.

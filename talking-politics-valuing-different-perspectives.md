This is part of our Schools That Work series and features key practices from Highlander Charter School in Rhode Island.

## Transcript

Student: More and more people are coming out. And then more and more people are becoming accepting of LGBT rights.

Soljane: If you are personally connected to an issue, might that make it harder or easier for you to go to that other side?

Student: If you have been affected by an issue and it’s like really, really– that made you who you are today, I think it’s really hard to change your views on that.

Pedro: I think this class has brung all of the seniors together a little more. It just taught us a lot in how to get along with each other and how to agree to disagree.

Jessica: At Highlander, we want students to be able to look at something critically. They need to know how to advocate for themselves, but they also know that they have to take in various perspectives.

Soljane: Our students come with these very firm ideas and beliefs about certain topics, because it’s the only perspective they’ve known. So, I really like to push the envelope with them.

Soljane: We’re going to revisit today some of those really tough issues that we’ve looked at this year.

Soljane: We’ve covered things like abortion, sexual assault on college campuses, immigration, presidential appointments. So, as the news has been happening and our country’s been evolving, that’s what we cover.

Alex: Today’s class the main focus was to see others’ perspective. That’s a recurring problem in the United States where we are too divided and we don’t listen to the other side.

Soljane: You know, it’s really an important skill for you to have, looking at things from the point of view of someone who has a different opinion. It’s not a wrong versus right. It’s a “Well, you know, what? Let me take a step over to your side.” Pedro: Prior to this I honestly wasn’t interested at all in any current events. I could care less about the news or anything, but ever since this class it made me more aware of, like, what’s going on around me.

Soljane: How many of you are thinking you’d like to revisit community police divide? Poverty blame game? And the LGBT debate? So, you’ll have ten minutes to review any of the resources for your topic.

Pedro: First, we learned background information.

Pedro: Blacks are twenty-four-point one percent– that’s the poverty rate. And Hispanics are twenty-one-point five.

Alex: And mostly we have discussions to see where we stand and we share our ideas and opinions.

Student: I put that it’s not their fault. It’s how they grew up.

Pedro: And we kind of debate and try and play devil’s advocate for both sides.

Pedro: I don’t agree with that, because there’s a bunch of Hispanics that are not poor and they chose to make the change in their life to get them out of the poverty.

Student: For a long time, LGBT groups have been attacked by religious groups. I think there has been a lot of laws that, like, discriminate. Like, because you’re a trans, don’t go use that– the bathroom that, you know– Kadeem: I’m from a very homophobic country. LGBT persons are usually being discriminated against. So, now I see the need to fit myself in their shoe and also accept them.

Soljane: I wanted to take a few minutes to maybe debrief this process. What was this like for you? Where is another place you might potentially be able to apply this?

Alex: I believe that we can apply this in the real world right now, because in America I feel like we pretty much block what we think is wrong.

Alex: What I have learned in class has prepared me to talk to new people and maybe people that I disagree with. Maybe you can educate them, maybe you can do your research and see if what they’re saying is right.

Soljane: I just really want them to have, like, a tool belt when they go into the real world.

Soljane: The fact that you were at least willing to step outside of your comfort zone and listen and acknowledge people– Soljane: It’s all about your ability to present yourself in a way that people will be receptive to what you want to say, even if it’s something that they don’t agree with.

Pedro: If you learned how to argue your point and listen to another person’s point without completely shutting them out, you can get where that person is coming from. That’s what makes us the strongest.

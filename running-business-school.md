## Transcript

Cashier: Order up.

Customer: Can I have a hot chocolate, please?

Cashier: Hot chocolate. What’s your name?

Customer: Emily.

Customer: Emily.

Narrator: Cafe Vine students learn how to be efficient. They learn how to be problem solvers. They’re very creative, and they also learn confidence. These are things that will carry over and help them in whatever field they end up working.

Cashier: Mallory? Mallory again.

Margery Covello: The vision of the school is to provide students with every opportunity possible, open every door. That means taking the learning out of the classroom, making it real, making it come alive, so that we’re really tapping into every student’s strengths.

Jason Corosanite: We’ve noticed that kids had an interest to work with outside companies. They were interested in entrepreneurship, so the notion came up of actually having a startup company in the building.

Eli Gutierrez: Cafe Vine is a student-run coffee shop that serves students and teachers.

Cashier: Good morning, madam. How may I help you?

Dana Corosanite: We thought that the cafe would be a great business model for the high school students. The kids see what it would be like to have a real job and what are some of the skills that they need to take with them.

Cashier: Please sign.

Kaitlin: You learn time management. You learn how to think on the spot. You learn how to communicate very well.

Zachary: At first I thought it was gonna be very easy to do everything, but back there with lots of people behind the counter, it’s really hard.

Dana Corosanite: All right, everyone, how did this morning go? The Cafe Vine elective meets for an hour each day. The students apply to the elective, and it has to fit in with their schedule. At the very start of class, we talk about how the morning shift went. How many people were doing bagels today?

Student: It was Kaitlin and Christian. They were just kinda back and forth, just hopping on other things if we needed help, and that– Kaitlin: I think first and foremost, we bond. We know how to create a team. “You have that, I have this, let’s work together.” I think that’s a great skill that we learn in Cafe.

Dana Corosanite: During the second half of elective, they can do small group skill training.

Eli Gutierrez: All the students will get to do all the roles, whether it’s a prep or a barista or a cash management.

Vincenzo: The attention to detail that I learned in Cafe has definitely made me a better student in my academic classes ’cause you have to listen in Cafe. You really have to make sure you’re getting every single detail correct.

Eli Gutierrez: You’re gonna go ahead and dip down once now. We teach them the origin of the bean and about the roaster. Once this gets to about 350, we’re gonna start our roast. We teach the kids different colors and smells and temperatures of each batch. See what you smell in there, and then write it down on the paper.

Dana Corosanite: Cafe Vine students sell the beans to different coffee shops locally.

Kaitlin: That was what really reeled me in, was how to run a business. It wasn’t so much making coffee or roasting beans. It was more how does that operate?

Dana Corosanite: One of the things that we work on often is inventory.

Student: Do we not have the other cups? There’s 13– Vincenzo: We can’t just go wasting supplies. The cafe does have a budget that you have to manage.

Dana Corosanite: We also have a scheduling app called Homebase.

Vincenzo: I have to manage who works what day.

Zachary: We’ll also talk about new ideas or what to add onto the menu.

Dana Corosanite: If there’s anything that looks like we need to tweak it a little in terms of the prices or… Okay.

Eli Gutierrez: For a lot of students, it is their first real job, so we give them the chance to have that experience.

Vincenzo: The cafe does give us some real, tangible skills that we can apply to real world.

Student: That’s $3.50. There’s something just really unique and special about being involved day-to-day and to feel the rhythm of what it’s like to be in a startup.

Kaitlin: It definitely creates chaos, but it’s a good flow. By the end of the shift, you feel good.

Casher: Order up.

Kaitlin: I love it all

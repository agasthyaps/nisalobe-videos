## Article

In the schools Edutopia visited for our Making Learning More Playful series (across four countries!), we saw greater teacher satisfaction and more student engagement. When kids are fully on board in the classroom, teachers have more time and energy to build rich, social, playful, student-centered learning opportunities, and they experience less burnout. The result?

Positive school communities where everyone flourishes, transformed by the fundamental shift toward making learning more playful.

## Transcript

Student: Go!

Jennifer Montgomery: When students are really engaged and they want to be in the room and they want to be learning, that makes it so much easier for a teacher because you’re all invested in the learning that’s happening. So it does help a lot with burnout because everyone wants to be there.

Student: It like, really changes your outlook on it.

Sarah Law: Push this down.

Sarah Law: When I first started our play-based journey, I was very apprehensive about it because you are taking a step back and you are kind of letting the children lead their learning.

Sarah Black: It’s really about empowering children and allowing them to be part of their education to be involved in planning, the organization. The initial input can be quite heavy, but I think it’s then a beautiful opportunity for me to be able to observe my children and how they’re getting on and developing the skills.

Student: Yeah, Go!

Fatima Belouahi: You’re also allowed to have props for your videos.

Fatima Belouahi: So playful learning means different things for each class or each grade, and for my ninth graders it means doing activities where the students are more creative or autonomous. The students always are in a frenzy in the beginning because there’s so much stuff in here that they can touch and use. But that’s what we want because that’s an indication of them being motivated and them being engaged in the lesson and actually having fun with it.

Sarah Law: Some trees, that would be a good idea.

Sarah Law: I would say that it does benefit the teacher as well as the students. You have more flexibility with your time to get to know the children.

Nicolaj Bech: I didn’t think it would come natural to me in the beginning. But every time we do something that’s not what we would call traditional, it just brings a different energy. Heather Balson-Riosa: Once upon a time, tell me about your beautiful house. Heather Balson-Riosa: I don’t like to be bored in the classroom, and so I often, when I’m teaching, if I’m like, oh, I’m getting a little tired, that’s when I say, OK, I got to do something to change it up. And you see it in their faces. So I think that’s when I see them giggling and laughing, I say yeah, that’s it, that’s great. They’re going to go home and say, I had fun at school today, and that’s what I want.

Student: Look, I think someone’s at the door.

Student: That’s a bear. “Hello? Who’s there?”

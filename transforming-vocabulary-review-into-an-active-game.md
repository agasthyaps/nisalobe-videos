# Transforming Vocabulary Review Into an Active Game

> In a game called Running Dictation, students use reading, speaking, and listening skills to convey a story to a partner—in another language.

## Article

At Albert Hill Middle School in Richmond, Virginia, middle school Spanish teacher Jamie Midyette organizes her classes into story units, where the stories she chooses become the basis for learning new vocabulary and sentence structures. At the beginning of each unit, she shares a story (often a video from YouTube) that she has broken into individual illustrations and images. Once the students practice the vocabulary and learn the progression of the story—a process that unfolds over multiple class periods—she introduces a vocabulary review game called Running Dictation that presents a new challenge and pulls all the language skills into a sort of relay race.

Students are paired up, and each group receives a handout that lists all of the sentences from the story, but they’re all out of order. Ideally, the students go outside—but in the case of bad weather, a hallway will suffice. Midyette scatters clipboards holding individual images from the story, each with a randomly assigned letter, a few dozen yards away.

When Midyette says, “Go,” one student in each pair runs to an image, studies it, and then returns to their partner to describe it in Spanish. The writer has to find the sentence on the handout and write the corresponding letter next to it. The students then change roles, and they keep going until they’ve matched each sentence with a letter.

The pairs are then challenged to number the sentences in the order they appear in the story. This friendly competition asks students to use many of their language learning skills—they must speak clearly to their partner, using the vocabulary they’ve learned from the story. Their partner must listen closely and recall the vocabulary.

And they must read the sentences carefully to match the correct letter. An added bonus? Because their partner is depending on them for information, students are motivated to understand the text and convey it clearly.

Students love the chance to get out of the classroom and use their sprinting skills as well as their language skills. And Midyette sees dividends in the students’ engagement every time she plays the game for vocabulary review. Running Dictation helps students to recall vocabulary and structure sentences—all while collaborating with classmates and boosting their energy.

Running Dictation is a beloved world languages activity originated by Jason Fritze and adapted by many teachers over the years, including Michele Whaley, Martina Bex of The Comprehensible Classroom , and Sarah Breckley. The worksheets seen in the video were sourced from La Familia Loca PLC , a professional learning community run by Anabelle Allen of La Maestra Loca , and the Simon’s Cat story slides from Simon Tofield’s comics were adapted from a presentation by Allison Litten. Midyette has made an editable blank version of the Running Dictation printables available for other educators to use (requires Google sign-in to make a copy).

## Transcript

Jamie Midyette: Because we do running dictations, students get to practice their reading, listening, and speaking skills while getting out of the classroom space and moving around and having fun with their classmates.

Jamie Midyette: My goals are that the students get a novel way to complete an activity, which could essentially be just a worksheet that they sit down and complete in silence, but this creates a spin to that and allows them to collaborate with other people and it gets them moving, it energizes them.

Jamie Midyette: [speaking in Spanish]. Before we do the running dictation, I would introduce the story and vocabulary along with the gestures and provide lots of repetitions of the vocabulary and the structures. So I have them practice in partners before we do the actual running dictation activity.

Student: [speaking in Spanish].

Jamie Midyette: That way I’m making sure, okay, they do know what the sentence means and they also know which sentence goes with which picture.

Students: [speaking in Spanish].

Jamie Midyette: [speaking in Spanish]. When the weather gets nice, my students always ask me to go outside. If it’s raining like it was today, we could at least go into the hallway, and even just leaving the classroom space provides a change of energy and it can increase the excitement and interest level for an activity. Each group of two has a list of sentences in Spanish that are about the story.

Nivek: You just need to be able to understand the synthesis and be able to decipher what’s in the pictures and explain to your partner and be ready to run.

Jamie Midyette: [speaking in Spanish]. One of them is going to be the runner, so they run to the picture and find the letter and run back to their partner to relay that information.

Student: [speaking in Spanish].

Jamie Midyette: And the other person is the writer. So they have the list of sentences and they’re going to be writing the letter that their partner tells them matches up with that sentence.

Jamie Midyette: And then they would switch on the next round. So the writer becomes the runner, and the runner becomes the writer. They continue until they’ve gotten all the letters matched up with a sentence, and then after they get all the letters, they then have a column for numbers where they have to put those sentences in chronological order based on what happened first in the story down to what happened last in the story.

Markey: To do running notation, you need to be able to focus and listen to your partner. You also need to be able to work well with other people. I know I’ve worked with people during this activity that I wouldn’t usually, and it’s really helped me make new friends.

Jamie Midyette: They’re developing their reading skills because they’re having to read the sentence and make meaning out of it. They’re also developing their listening skills because they have to listen really well to what their partner is telling them, and they’re also developing their speaking skills because they have to look at a picture and come up with the language to describe that picture in their head and then relay that to their partner through speaking.

Jamie Midyette: [speaking in Spanish].

Jamie Midyette: The running dictation allows for the students to start producing the language on their own because they’re starting to speak it. So to me, success looks like hearing my students communicating in the target language, and I think this activity inspires them to do that.

Teacher: All right, good morning, Sea Otters.

Class: Good morning, Miss Nguyen.

Teacher: All right, here we go.

Teacher: Intentional goal setting really allows my students to see growth mindset happening. It’s this idea of, like, if I speak it into existence, then those tiny, little, incremental goals can actually become big goals. First I ask the students to choose their intention or their goal for the day.

Teacher: Then I want them to think about what are they going to do to accomplish that goal and then they are sharing that with a partner.

Teacher: Turning your talking today, I intend to—?

Boy: Today I intend to show integrity while— Teacher: That person is also their accountability partner to basically hold them accountable, give them those reminders. Then at the very end of the day at closing circle, students talk about yes, I met my goal, I feel proud of myself, or I’ll try that again tomorrow. And the more you say a goal or your intention out loud, the more likely you’re able to follow through.

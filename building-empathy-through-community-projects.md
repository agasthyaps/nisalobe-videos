## Transcript

Student: That one won’t go.

Kelli Meadows: When we turn on the hoverboard, what’s gonna happen?

Student: It’s gonna hit.

Kelli Meadows: Because our students participate in meaningful projects, they are able to think outside of the box. They learn empathy and realize that their dreams may become a reality.

Teacher: Are you excited?

Student: Yeah!

Thom Coffee: Part of the fabric of Eminence culture is contributing to the larger society. So we really try to encourage kids to plug into what is a problem, or an issue, or a gap that needs to be filled, and then how can you contribute to that? So Wheels for Tate really starts with this idea that there is a kid in our building who has a need, and we feel like we can take a shot at solving that.

Kelli Meadows: The fifth grade classroom is at the other end of our building. Tate can’t walk that really, really, long distance, so my Special Ed. Director said, “Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if we could design a hoverboard chair?” We had about 27 kids sign up. We’ll talk about our parts and pieces, and what we need to do today to get it started.

Buddy Berry: I said, “Well, how are you gonna do that? You know, a mobilized wheelchair might be $15,000.” They started scouring the internet, and they came back and said, “We’re gonna do it for $400.” Harrison: We had this picture and a video it was based on.

Kelli Meadows: The kids came up with the idea to sell advertisements to go on back of the hoverboard wheelchair. So when you see any of those businesses, make sure that you give them a big thank you. Tate, can you tell us how does this make you Feel?

Tate: Happy.

Kelli Meadows: After we had the funding in place, the next step was to actually design the vehicle. We had to take Tate’s measurements to figure out the dimensions for the frame. We wanted to make sure that we could make it safe. Why did we chose to go with aluminum?

Student: It’s light and very strong.

Kelli Meadows: This morning the students worked on putting the vehicle together. So they had to file the aluminum, create the frame, attach all the pieces.

Bridget: It’s really cool. I’ve never done this before. It’s really helping me with math.

Student: Just measure the actuals to make sure it’s centered and the bolts are on tight.

Bridget: We had to put the wheels on the axle and the chair on top of it.

Kelli Meadows: We also had to think about the hoverboard and it’s placement. Guys, I see a problem with that hoverboard. I’m gonna wait and see if you guys can problem solve and figure it out yourself.

Student: It’s backwards.

Kelli Meadows: It’s backwards.

Student: It’s backwards?!

Student: And I tightened that thing really hard.

Kelli Meadows: We ran into a lot of problems, but once they figured it out on their own, they have so much more pride in their work.

Student: Once the plastic zip ties are secure, the chair should be secure. It’s secure.

Kelli Meadows: So, moving forward, we need to make sure it works, right? So we’re gonna test drive. Let’s explain to Tate, a refresher on what he needs to do.

Student: He needs to put equal weight on both feet and lean forward.

Kelli Meadows: There you go. Tate was so excited to hop on to the hoverboard wheel chair. He was able to sit down, and he was able to get his feet aligned.

Group: Here we go!

Student: Good job, Tate.

Student: So we’re trying to get handlebars so Tate can steer.

Kelli Meadows: Those handlebars are going to be so helpful for you.

Tate: Yeah!

Kelli Meadows: You did good!

Student: Good job, Tate!

Kelli Meadows: This project taught them more than I ever could in a 30 minute lecture. It allows the hands on experience. Also, building empathy was a really key piece.

Thom Coffee: Once you’ve made a difference for another human being, it’s really hard to stop that. When I see the kid who I built a mobility device for, and his eyes light up, and I’ve made his day that gets in you and you want to do more of that.

Harrison: It makes me feel good inside, because I’m doing something good, and no one gets left out.

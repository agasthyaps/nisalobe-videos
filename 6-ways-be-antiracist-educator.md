## Transcript

Dena: As we think about social-emotional learning, how can we as educators not ignore what’s happening in the world, not ignore the anti-Black racism, the injustice, and really have conversations about it? Because if we don’t practice having those conversations, and working across difference as young people, then we won’t learn it as adults. What’s the point about talking about interpersonal skills, without talking about the conflict that results from racism? It needs to be meaningful. It needs to feel authentic. And so as we move into the beginning of the year, it’s crucially important for our educators to really push themselves, and to push through that fear and discomfort. So face your fears, go into the classrooms, have the talks, because it is for the betterment of our society.

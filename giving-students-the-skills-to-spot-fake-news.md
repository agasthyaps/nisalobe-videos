## Article

“The need to address fake news and media literacy became very apparent in the last three to five years,” says Fairview High School social studies teacher Nikki Nies, when speaking about the overwhelming number of media sources in today’s world. “I started little by little to add that into my curriculum, and now that’s the biggest bulk of what I teach in my current events and media literacy course.” To help her students become adept at spotting fake news, Nies has designed a variety of lessons filled with fun interactive activities to help them better understand how it’s created and spread. From a red card/green card activity where students have to guess if a headline is real, to a “build and bust” exercise where students make their own fake news stories and try to fool their peers, students learn how easy fake news is to create—and how hard it is to detect.

Students also learn about different types of fake news, from subtle partisan media bias to full-blown conspiracy theories, and practice decoding AI images. Nies also shares the CRAP acronym —a well-known media literacy tool for deconstructing news articles. Students appreciate how relevant these skills are to their lives.

Eleventh-grade student Renee says, “ I recently turned 18, and this election was the first one that I voted in. So making sure that I had real and correct information was super important to me in the last couple of months. I wanted to form my own opinion rather than, like, listen to my parents.” For Nies, helping students be more well-rounded digital consumers is an important part of citizenship. ”I respect the students, and I hope that they respect me.

I want them to be able to debate things in an environment where everybody feels that they can speak their opinion, and that their opinion is respected as well.” For more resources on helping students learn how to spot fake news, read Tanner Jones’s article for Edutopia, “ Teaching Students to Analyze Fake News .”

## Transcript

Student: There’s a lot of like, “You won’t believe,” or “You must see,” or, yeah.

Student: The mysterious death.

Student: Cover-up.

Student: Yeah.

Student: Or like the all-caps in the title, like bombshell, McCarthy.

Student: I think this is probably partisan media bias.

Nikki Nies: Because my students have studied fake news, they are able to question their sources, to check reliability, and make informed decisions about what they read before they share.

Student: There’s probably some truth to the stories, but it’s— Nick: It’s leaning the one way.

Student: Yeah.

Dr.

Luke Beall: Our mission at Fairview High School is preparing students to be innovative learners. We want them to be mindful, respectful, and contribute to society when they leave us.

Nikki Nies: Morning, guys. Morning.

Student: Hi.

Nikki Nies: I think media literacy is so important because of the availability of sources out there. I want them to be digital consumers who know the difference between entertainment and real news. So if you open up your iPads, and that is a hyperlink to a Padlet. So today, to start the class, we talked about how the students get their news.

Renee: Honestly, I’m a typical teenager who tends to get their news from social media, whether that’s TikTok, or Instagram, or X.

Nikki Nies: We all have our phones all the time, right? We are instant reporters. And there is a problem with that because it’s unedited. So that brings us to what is fake news? Fake news is news that is reported as accurate, but lacks reliability and credibility. We talked about different types of fake news, like partisan, satire, and sensationalism. That clickbait idea. All right, we’re going to test to see how awesome we are in identifying fake or real news.

Nick: We hold up a green card if it was real, and a red card if it was fake.

Nikki Nies: “Hurricane Milton to Hit West Coast of Florida as a Category 3 Hurricane.” “Unbelievable! New Study Claims That Drinking Water Can Make You Lose Weight Instantly.” I was looking for when they saw that it was fake, that they knew why. What makes this headline fake?

Student: The two words, “unbelievable,” and then “instantly.” Nikki Nies: Good. All right, we got one last one. You guys ready? What do you think?

Renee: Mrs. Nies showed us a picture of the pope and demonstrated that fake news does not have to be in a written form; it could be in a picture or a video.

Nikki Nies: We followed that up with creating a fake news story.

Student: NASA’s Perseverance rover, currently exploring the surface of Mars— Renee: So we took a real news article, and we had to change certain pieces of information to make it fake, but almost undetectable. You could change like the scientists are cautiously optimistic to extremely optimistic.

Student: We could even say like a space organization, instead of like stating like a specific one.

Renee: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Nikki Nies: And then as a class, we saw if we could identify what was fake about it.

Student: In the last sentence, it talks about evidence that like life definitely existed on Mars, but we’re not going to be able to prove that, so it could be probably— Renee: The purpose of it was to show it’s easy to make fake news, and it’s difficult to detect. And then also making us practice looking for those minute details.

Nikki Nies: At the end of the class, we did a QR code activity. You’re going to go to the website that it opens, and I want you to decide, is it real news, fake news, or does it just show some media bias?

Trinity: There’s definitely some like click-baity things. It changes some of the things that I see on social media. It helps when you can go back and like double-check to make sure they’re telling the truth or not.

Nick: I turned 18 a while ago. This was the first election I voted in. So it was good to know like what’s real, what’s fake, and be able to make your own opinion and decide what you believe.

Nikki Nies: I hope they leave my class critical thinkers who question things before they click and share. Whatever your belief is, you should know why you believe that, and you should have some evidence to support that belief.

Student: I think that it uses omission to sort of make it seem much worse than it actually is.

Nikki Nies: Excellent. That was a great analysis.

## Transcript

As the end of the school year draws near, it’s a great time to pause, reflect and share how it went, for teachers and students alike. For older students, intentionally making time to look back and ahead can be a chance to celebrate accomplishments as a community and individually, as well as think about what is to come. Research suggests that showing gratitude may increase adolescent well-being. Provide students with blank thank you notes and ask them to think of a person who has had an impact on their lives this year. Maybe it is a parent, a friend, a coach, or a classmate. They can choose whomever they’d like. Offer writing prompts for crafting the note. It may help them think more deeply about why they are grateful for this person and help them articulate their thoughts and feelings. Measuring and noting growth is an important metacognitive exercise that helps young people take stock of what they’ve accomplished. Ask students to reflect on how they’ve grown and matured over the year and have them prepare a few talking points about their experiences. What skills have they developed? In what areas have they improved? What challenges have they overcome? Choose a day for them to share their speeches, whether it is in a special location like the auditorium or simply in the classroom by circling up the desks. Use the talking piece to help direct attention and to demonstrate to students how to be an active listener and respectful audience member. Imagining what the future might look like can be the first step toward laying out the path to get there. Ask students to write a letter to themselves one year in the future. Perhaps it is a letter of congratulations for achieving a goal they set. Or maybe a reminder of an important life lesson they want to keep in mind as they move through school. The focus can be both academic and personal, and they can choose the tone, whether funny or full of wisdom. The mental exercise of visualizing a goal has been shown to be very motivating and it can build confidence too.A collage that illustrates a student’s hopes and dreams is a great way to help them really think about what is important to them and prioritize accordingly. Pull out the art supplies and a big stack of magazines and ask students to use a posterboard to envision what they want their own futures to look like. In addition to images and representations, they can include words and phrases that will help them get there. Give students a chance to present their vision boards if they wish, ending the year with a celebration of who we are, how far we’ve come, and the potential of what is yet to be can be a powerful and fun experience for everyone.

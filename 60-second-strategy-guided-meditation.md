## Transcript

Teacher: All right, guys, find a space for meditation, please. We do meditation every day in our classroom. The school day can be really crazy. It’s a nice time just to stop, just to relax. So first, I get the kids to find a spot on the floor. Beautiful, you’re looking like you’re ready to do a really nice meditation. We take a couple of breaths. Well done. I used a guided meditation on my phone, which is really easy.

Narrator: Just let yourself be quiet, and listen to what I describe.

Teacher: We started with one minute, and moved to a little bit longer, a little bit longer, and now they’re up to about six minutes.

Narrator: And you see the blue sky through the trees.

Teacher: Then as the meditation ends, I get them to wiggle their toes, wiggle their fingers and we’re focused and ready for learning. How do you feel? You feel calm? Yeah? Do you feel ready to learn? Great job, guys.

# Neuroscientists Say Don&#8217;t Write Off Handwriting

> Brain scans reveal crucial reading circuitry flickering to life when young readers print letters and then read them. The effect largely disappears when letters are typed or traced.

## Article

We look at two studies which compare handwriting to typing—both conclude that handwriting taps into brain networks associated with deeper learning. That doesn’t mean we should toss out our keyboards, though. Kids with processing disabilities like dysgraphia or dyslexia often benefit from computer technology, and all kids need to develop digital skills.

To dig deeper into the research cited in the video, see Eva Ose Askvik, F. R. (Ruud) van der Weel, and Audrey L. H. van der Meer’s 2020 study on the importance of cursive handwriting over typewriting for learning in the classroom and Karin H.

## Transcript

For most kids, typing on keyboards just doesn’t cut it. In 2012, brain scans of pre-literate children revealed crucial reading circuitry flickering to life when kids hand printed letters and then read them. Ominously, the effect largely disappearedwhen the letters were typed or traced. And in 2020, researchers analyzed the brain activity of older kids, seventh graders while they wrote, drew or typed words. Those researchers concluded that handwriting and drawing produced telltale neural tracings, indicative of deeper learning. But that doesn’t mean we should toss out our keyboards. Kids with processing disabilities like dysgraphia or dyslexia often benefit from computer technology. And all kids need to develop digital skills. But the neuroscience is clear. It’s too soon to abandon the teaching of handwriting, which appears to be intimately linked to our earliest efforts to read and also improves our ability to recognize letters, spell and remember the material we’re writing about.

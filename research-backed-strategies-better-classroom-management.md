Narrator: Sometimes, misbehavior or inattention isn’t what it seems. For many students it stems from boredom or restlessness, seeking attention from peers, behavioral disorders, or struggling with issues at home. And some misbehavior is just a healthy part of a child’s social and emotional development. Here are six common classroom management mistakes, and what the research suggests you should do instead. A strategy that works for one student may backfire for another. Look for patterns in the behavior that might reveal the underlying reasons and consider checking in with the student to see if the source of the problem can be identified. In a 2018 study, academic frustration explained student misbehavior 20 percent of the time. Students either didn’t understand the assignment, or it was too difficult, and misbehavior was an outlet for their disappointment. You don’t have to fix all misbehavior. In fact, trying to do so can actually makes things worse in the long run. Negative attention can make students feel marginalized, leading to more behavioral issues later on. Instead, highlight positive conduct, like finishing work on time or efficiently transitioning between activities. Data Walls, Behavior Charts and other public displays of misbehavior don’t improve student conduct according to a 2019 study. Instead of calling students out publicly, approach them privately, and encourage them to reflect on the wrongdoing, think about its source, and take responsibility for addressing it. You can’t expect kids to work with you without putting in the emotional labor. Demanding compliance will often result in kids rebelling, testing boundaries or engaging in power struggles. Try proactive strategies like positive greetings at the door, cocreating classroom norms, and building and maintaining strong relationships. Are all students being treated equally and fairly? Teachers often give black students fewer warnings to correct their misbehavior, for example, when compared to their white peers. School systems must address broader discipline policies, but within classrooms teachers can start by reflecting on their own implicit biases. They can also make it a practice to regularly review their disciplinary measures to see if there are areas for improvement.

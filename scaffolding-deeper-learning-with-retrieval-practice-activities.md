# Scaffolding Deeper Learning With Recall Activities

> When students are asked to recall relevant knowledge just before applying it, they arrive at a more concrete understanding of the content.

## Article

Math teacher Maggie Arnold is about to launch a final summative project on a statistics unit in her ninth-grade Algebra class at Frederick High School in Frederick, Maryland. Before turning students loose to work on the project, Arnold first has them participate in a series of retrieval practice activities that bring their background knowledge and the math skills they’ve been working on for the last couple of weeks back into the forefront, so they are crystal clear. Learning Science Partners’ Jim Heal explains why this is good practice.

“When inviting students to engage in a task, it’s crucial to activate the prior knowledge they will need to succeed,” he says. “They can pull previously learned information into the here and now—where it will be useful for them in the current learning.” After providing students with a high-level view of the project they are about to embark on, Arnold asks students to work on individual whiteboards. She instructs them to spend three minutes jotting down any phrases, symbols, vocabulary, and charts that they remember from the last several lessons—a brain dump.

After giving them time to recall individually, she groups students into fours and asks them to consolidate their knowledge onto a large whiteboard. According to Arnold, this second step is crucial. “Recalling is the first step—that’s surface level, where you’re just throwing ideas at it,” she says.

But during the second step, when the students are collaborating, “you have to think about the content and be able to communicate and explain to somebody in your group about what you’re talking about.” Arnold then displays the large whiteboards around the room, and the class does a gallery walk. She asks them to look for connections between the boards—as well as any math content they did not include on their own displays. Arnold is up front with students about why retrieval practice activities are important.

“I tell the kids, ‘You just have to work out that muscle. The more you recall, the stronger you get. It’s just like working out.’” She smiles.

“That’s just how the brain works.” This video is part of our “ How Learning Happens ” series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Maggie Arnold: Read the instruction. Give me some feedback… Dr.

Jim Heal: When inviting students to engage in a task, it’s crucial to activate the prior knowledge they will need to succeed, where they can pull previously learned information into the here and now, where it will be useful for them in the current learning.

Maggie Arnold: You all know about the statistics project that we are about to start. And in order to do that, we need to make sure that you have foundation, meaning background knowledge about what the heck we’ve been learning for the past week.

Maggie Arnold: In order to do the final project to present their data using different type of graph representations, they have to have the content down. The objective is for students to recall everything that we’ve learned in Module 12 about statistics so far.

Maggie Arnold: Everybody needs the time to think, so I would like you to take that three-minute time to think independently.

Maggie Arnold: First three minutes, no talking, just drawing pictures, drawing different type of graph, math symbols, or just writing sentences that they remember for statistics that we have learned in class so far.

Maggie Arnold: OK, so three minutes up.

Maggie Arnold: And then after they have independently recalled on their individual personal little boards… Maggie Arnold: I’m going to give you a big, big vertical whiteboard.

Maggie Arnold: I asked them to work in groups of four, and put their ideas together, and summarize everything that everybody has to contribute, and present it on the whiteboard.

Maggie Arnold: And what you will do is to consolidate what everybody is contributing to the table.

Maggie Arnold: So the recalling—the first step, which is jotting down—that’s the surface, where you’re just throwing ideas at it. But the second step is when they are collaborating, you have to think about the content, and being able to communicate and explain to somebody in your group about what you’re talking about.

Student: There’s two numbers and a set of values. Then you find the mean.

Maggie Arnold: When somebody has a misconception or is asking a question, now you have to think about the content even further.

Maggie Arnold: Can you rephrase, say the question— Student: I mean, I know what it looks like. It’s just— Student: Oh! That? That’s like, OK, so this one is— Student: Oh, yeah, you, uh, just… Maggie Arnold: In collaborative work, I just facilitate the learning, and let them go at it. Then once everybody is done, we put all of the boards up on the back.

Student: We didn’t write this or this.

Maggie Arnold: I have them walk around and kind of see if they saw something in the other whiteboard that they have not added, gaps that they might have forgotten as a group, but now we have somebody else in the class that filled in that gap.

Jim Heal: We know that retrieval practice is a very helpful strategy, both because it strengthens student memory of core content, but it also allows the teacher to very precisely direct student attention to the ideas they want them to engage in, and the type of learning they want them to do.

Maggie Arnold: This is where your final products go. And in many ways… Maggie Arnold: The content of what we cover, which is box plot, bar graph, histogram, box and whisker, different type of vocabs, is all of the content that they will need to use with transferring that over into real project. With retrieval practice, I tell the kids, “You just have to work out that muscle.” The more you recall, the stronger you get. It’s just like working out. That’s just how the brain works.

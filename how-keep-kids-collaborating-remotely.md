Narrator: It’s easy to let group work fall by the wayside when you can’t be in the room to ensure focus. Even for those teaching in person right now, social distancing prevents students from gathering around shared documents of devices. But using digital tools to collaborate can keep students connected, sharpen their tech skills and support core academics. Here are five ways to enable your students to work together when they can’t be near one another. Many schools already use basic tools designed for collaboration, like Google Docs or slides. Ask students to build on each other’s work in a presentation. Revision history will let you track contributions by author and help your students avoid accidental lost work. Ask students to create a digital bulletin board together to manage a project, organize information, or show their thinking. Tools that offer virtual collaboration walls for stickies or images, such as Padlet or Nearpod Collaborate are easy to learn. Brainstorms, gallery walks, and sequencing activities can all be taken online with an interactive whiteboard tool like Jamboard. Breakout rooms can pose a management challenge, but they can be a great way to facilitate virtual discussions or small group work for older students while using a videoconferencing tool like Zoom. Keep students on track by joining random breakout rooms or hold them accountable with shared documents. Harness students’ enthusiasm for virtual worlds by assigning them to work on models together in an immersive environment. Many games like Minecraft and Roblox offer support and tools just for educators. Connect the project to their learning outside the virtual world and set parameters around which tools or materials can be used to avoid a potential time suck. Ask students to record videos to show their learning with a popular tool like Flipgrid, and classmates can comment on them, or make response videos. Many apps allow students to reflect on each other’s uploaded work, like Seesaw. Sharing guidelines for appropriate and respectful use of tools like this is key for a great peer feedback experience for students. Ultimately, the same best practices will help your students collaborate remotely via technology as anywhere else; setting clear ground rules and expectations together, designating roles and scaffolding the basic skills needed, and closely tracking student work and progress. With a little bit of tech knowhow, you can get your students back into a collaborative zone, no matter where they are.

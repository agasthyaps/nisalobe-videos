## Article

It’s a common scenario: A teacher poses a question, a few students raise their hands, one is selected to share a response, and class moves on. Tight time limits and a gauntlet of content to cover can make this seem like a necessary routine. However, there are certain questions that warrant giving the entire class time to answer thoughtfully.

And it can be hard for a teacher to gauge who is actually doing the thinking when only a few students speak up. Enter Think, Ink, Pair, Share—a classic classroom strategy with one added step that gives everyone in class a moment to process important content. In Michele Cramer’s AP Psychology class at Frederick High School in Frederick, Maryland, students are preparing for the AP exam.

They are reviewing a lesson about how memory works, content that could very well make an appearance on the exam later in the year. After posing a question about key processes, Cramer asks her students to take a moment to write out their responses. Students scribble away in their notebooks or scraps of paper before pairing up to share ideas with a partner.

“We know from cognitive science that whenever a student writes as they are thinking through an idea, they are likely to process it more deeply.” explains Learning Science Partners’ Jim Heal, “And therefore they will have more chance of encoding and remembering that information in the future.” For Cramer, the added step is well worth it. “It does take a little bit longer for everybody to answer the question, pair up with someone, share out. But it is the better practice,” she explains.

“I can see that everybody is actually (hopefully!) effortfully thinking.” For additional variations to boost the strategy’s value—including more ways to integrate a writing step like Think, Ink, Pair, Share does—read Todd Finley’s article for Edutopia, “ 16 Variations on Think-Pair-Share to Keep Students Engaged .” This video is part of our How Learning Happens series, which explores teaching practices grounded in the science of learning and human development.

## Transcript

Michele Cramer: We are going to talk about explaining our memory process.

Dr.

Jim Heal: It can be all too tempting for teachers to fall into the trap of what I call chasing the hands. This looks something like posing a question to the class, waiting for a few hands to shoot up into the air, and then inviting those students to offer their thinking to the room. In reality, whenever this happens, we are in essence leaving to chance whether or not all students have been invited to think.

Michele Cramer: I’m going to start back here with Makayla. Sometimes you call on that person that raises their hand, and you do that because there’s so much content to cover, and you ask a question and you move on. But in reality, everybody should be answering that question. Today we’re doing memory retrieval. We used to have the strategy think, pair, share. Now we’re building on that. They’re actually writing out their answers. You’re going to answer independently on your paper, then you’re going to pair up and then you’re going to share out. OK?

Dr.

Jim Heal: We know from cognitive science that whenever a student writes as they are thinking through an idea, they are likely to process it more deeply and therefore will have more chance of encoding and remembering that information in the future.

Michele Cramer: I can see that everybody is actually, hopefully, effortfully thinking, and then they pair up, have a discussion.

Student: I think it definitely fits because serial position effect says that first and last are easier to remember.

Michele Cramer: And then I ask someone to share out.

Student: I recalled the first info because it was easier. It just popped in my brain.

Michele Cramer: Perfect. Primacy effect, right?

Student: Primacy, yeah.

Michele Cramer: OK.

Dr.

Jim Heal: In this strategy, in addition to ensuring everyone thinks, writing things down, we actually know, invites a deeper level of processing and means that everyone is not just thinking, but thinking deeply.

Student: With the elaborative processing and giving meaning to things you want to remember, so that would include the distributed practice in the spacing effect.

Michele Cramer: Yes. Oh my gosh. I love it. It does take a little bit longer for everybody to answer the question, pair up with someone, share out, but it is the better practice. Thanks guys. You did fabulous.

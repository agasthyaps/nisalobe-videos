## Article

Studies suggest that when students have the opportunity to lead their own learning and participate in the teaching of others, their own engagement, understanding, and even well-being increase. At Dyce Primary School in Aberdeen, Scotland, teachers have seen this firsthand as they’ve empowered students in developing learning experiences for themselves and their peers. To learn more about the research behind the practices seen in the video, check out the links below.

## Transcript

Jenny Watson: At Dyce Primary, we really want the children to lead their own learning, but also to lead the learning of others. There’s nothing better than seeing them getting totally lost in their learning, because they’re motivated, because they’re engaged.

Jenny Watson: Our whole curriculum is driven by nine expeditions. So, right now, our big expedition question is what gives us power. The children are invited to explore the big question in a variety of different ways.

Emma Hart: So, the way our expeditions run is we have them usually for a month, three to four weeks, we know what the big question is, and we’ll pop that big question to the students. And in Primary 7, we give them planning time, and they come up with what activities could we do during their expedition, they’ll brainstorm with a little group of pupils, and then we write all those ideas down, and as a class we can choose the ideas that we would like to run with, and those are run by the Primary 7s.

Sarah Black: They have their ideas, which, of course, they bring really amazing to the table, things that we wouldn’t have thought of, but then we have to kind of coach them into making it a lesson for the rest of the class.

Sarah Black: Today we had a team-building activity that was the marble run, the electricity games.

Student: Where you have to get the electricity from the wind turbine down to the house.

Student: Four crates per group. So, yeah, go!

Hope: Our expeditions are all about power right now. We had the cones up the top, which were the wind turbines, and the house is down here, so, they had to get the electricity from the wind turbine to the house.

Emma Hart: We’ve seen huge jumps with expedition. At the beginning it was a lot of fights, a lot of people saying, “I don’t want to play anymore, I don’t want to do this anymore, it didn’t work!” And we had to really step-by-step it.

Student: So, we’re trying to make it to the house.

Student: That won’t work. That won’t work.

Emma Hart: It has been a lot of work for them to be able to have a strategy. Maybe it’s “I need to compromise right now—my idea isn’t going to get chosen,” or a case of being able to play about with it and know that you’re not going to get into trouble for doing that, because a lot of classroom settings it’s like there’s one way to do it, and that’s the way that the teacher told you to do it.

Emma Hart: Whereas this, it was really bringing it all back and going, “No, it’s OK to make mistakes, and we actually learn from those mistakes. Let’s keep trying it.” Student: It worked the first time.

Student: It’s because of the bump.

Student: No, it’s because of this. Look!

Student: We’ve already captured it.

Student: Like that, yeah! Go! All right! That’ll work.

Student: One more time!

Student: Here it comes!

Students: Yay!

Emma Hart: It starts to kind of rewire different pathways in their head of saying, “I’m actually accepted in this space,” and “My value and the things that I’m going to put forward, they are beneficial to the rest of my classmates.”

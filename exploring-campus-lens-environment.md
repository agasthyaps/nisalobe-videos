When students arrive at The Greene School in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, what they see is unlike any other school they’ve attended before. A long road winds through the woods before revealing buildings that seem more suited for a campground than an educational facility. Situated on 74 acres of forest, with wetlands and a pond, The Greene School’s campus and learning environment are notably different than many traditional schools, and they take full advantage of their unique location.

The school was intentionally founded with a focus on environmental stewardship, and educators there aim to help students understand the world around them—and their impact on it. As part of their first semester at the school, all ninth graders take a field ecology class that fulfills a science requirement. “It’s their first introduction and immersion into our mission—what it means to explore the interdependence of humans and natural world, and what it means to engage in issues of sustainability,” says teacher Damaris Borden.

“We’re not just learning in the classroom, but we’re getting in the field, collecting data, doing observations—just immersing ourselves in the natural world.” Each year, students prepare to showcase the knowledge they’ve gained by hosting their families and community members for a tour in the late fall, where they share details about the various ecosystems on campus. This year’s field ecology students were especially excited to show off the beaver dam. In Borden’s classroom, students prepare by revisiting the questions they had about their campus at the beginning of the semester, sorting out what queries have been answered and what they still want to explore.

While students come to her with different levels of experience with the outdoors, Borden notes, “there’s a sense of pride and satisfaction, and real reflection on their own abilities and how they support each other,” that grows stronger over the course of the year.

## Transcript

Damaris Borden: What do you notice? What can you maybe hypothesize about it? And then what does that mean for our ecosystem? “Ecology” comes from the Greek word oikos , which means “home.” So ecology is the scientific study of home. The goal of field ecology and having all of the freshmen take it is it’s their introduction to this campus, our wonderful living laboratory, and it’s also their first introduction and just immersion into our mission, what it means to explore the interdependence of the human and natural world.

Student: Do they keep the bark that they harvest in their lodge or by the dam?

Damaris Borden: Does anyone know the answer to that?

Student: In the lodge.

Damaris Borden: Yeah. We’re not just learning in the classroom, but we’re getting out in the field, collecting data, doing observations, just immersing ourselves in the natural world. This expedition was called Into the Woods. It was focusing on forest ecosystems, how forests provide us with all kinds of benefits, just recreationally, aesthetically, as well as purifying our air, sequestering carbon. Friday is their showcase for the expedition. They will be leading campus tours to share what they’ve learned with their families and with the broader public. There’s a lot of learning to do in the classroom to support that work. Let’s go ahead, take a look at our driving question board and put it in these buckets. What have we figured out? What are we not sure about? What are we maybe partway there? At the beginning of the year, we started a driving question board. And so yesterday, we were taking stock of that of, OK, what have we learned? And what do we want to pick out from that to share at our showcase?

Student: If we go where the beaver lodges are, we can show all of the individual trees.

Damaris Borden: And then we chose a route together. We’ve got our trail that goes kind of around the pond, right? To give them talking points. So how about we start with these two side trails? After planning our tour, getting some ideas, we went out there and did a little practice. What’s the first thing you think you might want to share?

Student: Well, the beavers, they built the dam so they can block off water and create different water sources.

Damaris Borden: One of my favorite things about this place is the diversity of backgrounds and experiences that our students bring to this school. We have the students who are very familiar and comfortable with the natural world. They’re drawn here because of our mission.

Student: They bring wood and other things like that for different seasons.

Damaris Borden: And it’s also really rewarding to teach the students who aren’t super familiar or super comfortable with being outside, being in the woods, laying in the dirt and having bugs around them.

Adriel: When I came in freshman year, I was that one person, I hated bugs, I hated spiders, I hated all of it, but I feel like it helped me acknowledge how much beauty there is in nature. Especially growing up in a more urban area, you don’t really see forests and stuff like that when you’re walking down the streets of Pawtucket or Providence. And so I would say it was definitely helpful just being able to really take it in.

Damaris Borden: There’s a sense of just pride and satisfaction, and just real reflection on their own abilities and also how they support each other.

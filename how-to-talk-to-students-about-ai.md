As educators around the country grapple with the classroom implications of easily accessible large-language models of generative AI, one thing is clear—it’s critical to talk to students about it, both to assess their usage and understanding and to set clear boundaries. Teachers can get started by scoping out what students know early in the year. One quick way to level-set is to offer provocative AI-related writing or discussion prompts.

For younger students, something as simple as “What is AI?” can yield a quick scan of their prior knowledge. For older ones, a more complex question like “What worries you about AI in education?” can help teachers understand the landscape of how their students are thinking about AI. It can also be useful to guide students through an understanding of the promises—and pitfalls—of AI use.

Giving examples of AI fails, like the Chicago Sun-Times summer reading list , can remind students to be skeptical. But it’s also valuable to share the ways in which AI can be most useful—like when it functions as a tutor by asking probing questions of students instead of providing quick answers. For teachers who have decided to allow AI use, a framework like the stoplight system , shared by Pennsylvania administrator Samuel Mormondo, can be useful to set parameters and keep teachers and students on the same page.

Narrator: It’s clear by now that artificial intelligence is quickly changing the education landscape, but for every AI tool promising to revolutionize teaching, there’s an article criticizing the technology’s influence on student learning. While the stakes are high, a 2025 survey found that only 31 percent of teachers in the U.S. have received guidance from their schools on how to deal with AI ethically and effectively. Many don’t know where to begin talking about it in their classrooms. As AI becomes increasingly prevalent, it’s essential for both teachers and students to have these conversations. Here are three tips for getting started. Over 70 percent of high school students are already using AI, but every kid in the classroom is different. You likely have a mix of students who regularly rely on AI to complete assignments, sometimes without thinking on their own, while others use it only occasionally or not at all. The first step to a meaningful dialogue about AI is to find out what your students do and don’t know. Start with a whole class or small group discussion. For younger or less tech-savvy students, you can ask, how do you know whether something AI writes is accurate? Or even what is AI? For teens, you might address ethical questions. Should students be allowed to use ChatGPT to help them write an essay? Or what worries you about AI and education? Learning where your students are at now will help guide future conversations and allow you to tailor your assignments going forward. For some students, generative AI feels like magic. Ask any question, get a long, well-thought-out answer. But it’s not that simple. A chatbot might confidently spit out false information or even perpetuate bias and harmful stereotypes. In 2025, the Chicago Sun-Times used AI to publish a summer reading list, which included several books that don’t exist at all. Discuss this or have students research other real-life examples of AI mishaps, reminding them that this technology is not always accurate. But AI can be a useful tool for learning, too. Students can use ChatGPT to quickly analyze data or break down complex processes in simple language. Chatbots can even act as tutors, generating quizzes or asking students probing questions on a topic to help them learn more deeply. If you do choose to use AI in the classroom, emphasize the importance of critical thinking and fact-checking. Once you and your students have developed a shared understanding, you can set boundaries that make sense for your class. If you’re open to letting students use AI in their work, one easy-to-implement model is the stoplight system, created by an educator to delineate when using AI is and is not appropriate. A red light means AI usage is not permitted in this assignment. These activities might include quizzes or short-answer questions that are designed to assess a student’s understanding of the material. With a yellow light, AI is an option, but students need to get your permission first. Be sure to discuss with students what they hope to achieve by incorporating AI into their work. A green light is the most open approach, useful for generating research questions or brainstorming for creative writing or design tasks. Even when students have your permission to use AI, it’s a good idea to establish spaces where they can share their plans and get feedback from you and their peers. AI is constantly evolving, and it can be confusing to know how to talk to your classes about using it responsibly. You don’t have to have all the answers, just a willingness to work alongside your students and navigate this new technology together.

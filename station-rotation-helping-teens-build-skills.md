## Article

Hannah Horner, a science teacher at Spring Mills High School in Martinsburg, West Virginia, was talking to her 8-year-old son when she had a revelation. Her son’s favorite activity in elementary school is stations—the chance to rotate around the classroom and try something new at each station. Her realization?

Station rotation would translate perfectly to her high school science classes. To organize stations in her classroom, Horner first identifies the primary goal she wants students to meet, such as being able to differentiate between types of cells. She then breaks down that concept into smaller, skills-based chunks.

Each station asks students to take on a distinct hands-on task, and the stations complement and build on each other. To begin class, Horner explains the activity at each station. Students then form small groups and pick a station to begin.

Stations offer a chance to reinforce skills and concepts that students learned earlier in the unit. Because students had previously learned about the parts of a microscope, one of the stations asked them to label those parts on a diagram. Another station reviewed the similarities and differences between plant and animal cells.

At the same time, stations give students the chance to stretch their knowledge and create new skills. A third station, for example, asked students to make their own slide for the first time. Because they know how to use a microscope and look at cells, they’ve built the confidence to try this higher-level activity.

Horner sees a number of benefits to the practice. After a long day of sitting at desks, students are energized by the chance to move around. When they encounter a challenging station, they’re less likely to be overwhelmed because the activity is a reasonable size—and they have their fellow classmates to help them.

Meanwhile, Horner rotates around the room, checking in and offering tailored support when needed. In addition to building science skills, stations challenge students to practice time management. Horner recommends that students spend between seven and 10 minutes at each station, but she doesn’t set a timer.

Students pace themselves, spending more time at stations that challenge them and moving more quickly through stations that they find simpler. The result is that students are always doing something productive; when they’ve completed a station, they move on. Horner also notes the benefits for classrooms that have limited equipment: “With stations, you can cut down on the amount of resources, because instead of needing 20 microscopes in my classroom today, I needed six—and I could have done it with three.” And station rotation is highly adaptable—at Spring Mills High School, English classes have used stations to examine Romeo and Juliet .

Even the admins designing the school’s professional development activities have caught on, implementing stations as they train teachers to keep them engaged and learning new skills. From 8-year-olds to adults, stations offer a flexible, hands-on way to learn—at any age.

## Transcript

Hannah Horner: Sure. Yep. If you can see it great on medium, draw it on medium. If you move up to high, draw it on high. Because we have stations, I have students who are more engaged and who are more prepared to actually do science in the real world. Students are actively up moving through your classroom and engaging with each other and with content in order to build hands-on skills. It’s a time check you’re looking at 2:07. Use that to kind of inform your movements. The mission of Spring Mills High School has always been to create and foster well-prepared students. And we do that through inclusion and connection. And stations is a way that students can connect with their peers. They can connect with their teacher. They can connect with their content beyond the pages of a book. Venn diagrams, very similarly to what we did in class, compare, contrast. This is where you show me what you know. Then you’re going to show me what you can do. The first thing you want to do with stations is figure out what your ultimate goal is. For today, it was, can I differentiate between cell types? Once you’ve narrowed down that big theme, then it’s breaking it into chunks. What are the different skills that we can work on that help build towards that ultimate goal? Rotate at your own pace. Let’s go. This is a check-in point for me to see where we’re at with the content and can we engage in some higher-level thinking and some higher-level tasks? So we’ve already learned microscopes in our last unit, but I like to make my curriculum circular. We need to come back to those skills so they don’t just disappear. So I gave them a station where it was already labeled. Could they tell me what they already knew? Then in the same station, they had to make a slide and they’ve never made a slide in their lives. And so, they’re building on that knowledge and they’re scaffolding it in. And it seems really challenging, but I’ve held their hand to get there.

Student: It looks the same as that. It almost looks like a seashell.

Student: Yeah.

Hannah Horner: If it’s got a nucleus, it’s not a… Chason: Me personally, I’m a hands-on person. I learn with my hands. It’s just how I’ve been raised. So learning from a lecture is a lot harder than doing a lab.

Hannah Horner: I have an 8-year-old elementary school son, and stations is his favorite activity. He comes home and it’s the first thing he wants to tell me about because it’s active. He gets to get up, he gets to move around the classroom. And the more he talked about it, the more I realized, “There’s no reason we couldn’t scaffold this into a high school classroom.” They also are just big kids, and they have very short attention spans a lot of time, and they have a real tendency to be hard on themselves. But with stations, when things get tough, you have a few more minutes to keep pushing and then you know you get a break.

Ava: From working with our classmates, there’s a lot of like we get to talk about it, we get to understand it more. If you have confusion, somebody in your group probably knows how to explain it. And if they don’t, then Mrs. Horner comes over and provides a lot of extra information. So it’s really helpful.

Hannah Horner: So then, I would keep it actually on your medium power right here, because you can pretty clearly see the structure and then you can also see your nucleus. One of the great parts of stations is the active collaborative learning. So they are truly feeding off of each other. And what’s great about that is you might have a student who’s really confident in one skill set and another who’s confident in a different skill set. And so they can sort of help each other through that process and it doesn’t feel as daunting. With my upper-level students, I want to teach them time-management skills. So what you’ll hear me say is, “I recommend this amount of time per station, but move at your own pace.” There’s very little wasted time.

Kaelyn: Me and my partner, we’re taking our time to try to actually understand what we’re doing, but at the same time, in a timely manner.

Hannah Horner: If I were to type all of these activities up into one document for them and make them work sequentially, it’s overwhelming. But when it’s small pieces, the high schooler brain tells them, “Oh, I can do this. I can lock in for six minutes.” We are taking small snapshots, small skills, small concepts, and using them to build together into something greater. We will come back to these tomorrow. You should be on your fourth or going into your fifth tomorrow in order to be on time. OK? All right, reset.

## Article

In Fatima Belouahi’s classroom in Copenhagen, Denmark, she uses a popular small group activity called role reading to help scaffold her ninth graders’ comprehension of challenging texts. Students are placed in groups of three, then assigned a task to do as they work through the material: One student reads aloud, another writes a summary, and a third comes up with a title for the paragraph. With this approach, students must demonstrate their understanding as they go, which helps bolster their grasp of the text—and the likelihood of getting lost goes down.

## Transcript

Teacher: You have to be three people in each group while reading, because each person is going to get a role. Role reading is something that we do when reading texts that are a bit difficult. First, the students are put into groups. It’s easier when you sit with others to ask questions or to ask someone else to explain what something means. One person reads a paragraph aloud from the text. One person has to summarize, so you’re also forced to listen to somebody else while reading, and one person has to give the paragraph a title, and that’s to secure that they have understood whatever they have read. They’re not able to hide when role reading, because you have a responsibility in that group, but it’s a bit easier than it is if I told everyone to just read the text individually. My students remember text better because they have worked through the text in different ways.

## Transcript

Narrator: We know that drawing is a powerful tool for learning, but a recent study concludes that not all drawings are created equal. After reading through five science texts, researchers asked fifth graders to sketch what they’d learned using either representational or organizational drawings. Representational drawings, a simple diagram of a cell or a depiction of a scientific theory, helped students recall factual information, but fell short when it came to deeper comprehension. Students who drew organizational sketches, like concept maps, anchor charts, and sketchnotes, were able to tease out relationships between concepts and see the big picture more clearly. By visually mapping their knowledge, organizational sketches help kids spot big gaps in their learning, improving their metacognition and providing them with a handy tool to evaluate their progress. In the process, organizational drawing boosted students’ performance on higher-order thinking tests by fourfold when compared to representational sketching.

Narrator: The big insight? Drawing out your learning is a remarkably effective way to consolidate knowledge, and you don’t need to be an artist to reap the benefits. Charts, simple sketches that link concepts by arrows and annotations, and other rudimentary knowledge maps are powerful tools that are accessible to everyone, not just the kids who feel confident in their drawing skills.

## Article

In Nicole Goepper’s French classes at Fauquier High School in Warrenton, Virginia, games aren’t something extra: They’re woven into the structure of the classes, and they happen every day. From learning new vocabulary to conjugating verbs, kids can’t wait to win. “I think when there’s, like, competition and, like, a prize involved or whatever,” says 10th-grade student Kiersten, “it really helps motivate us to want to, like, beat each other.” Each table group is a team (named after a French comic character, such as Asterix, Lucky Luke, or Caillou).

And throughout class, teams have the opportunity to win paper euros, which can be cashed in for prizes. On any given day, students may participate in a verb conjugation Riff-Off (inspired by Pitch Perfect ) or whiteboard relay, the colors game (where students race to different walls to touch the color that Mme. Goepper names in French), the numbers game (where students line up and form complex numbers, say 1789), or the body parts game (where students must hit certain body parts on a drawing of a human body on the whiteboard, using colorful fly swatters), to name just a few.

“To the people who say, ‘Oh, she can do that because she’s teaching a foreign language,’” says Goepper, “you could take any of those games and put it in a math class, history class, science class—songs for concepts, for periods of history, for math equations.” “In classes a lot, you’re just kind of in your own little bubble, in your own little shell,” 11th grader Addie points out. “But for this, it’s like everyone’s having fun, and it creates a good environment, a good space to just kind of get a break, which I think is really important in schools and classes. I think it motivates students to learn.” She also points out that the verb songs she learned in beginning French are still in her head years later, proving that Mme.

Goepper’s techniques seem to be working.

## Transcript

Nicole Cooper: En commence avec quatorze. I believe games are very beneficial in the learning environment. It motivates kids.

Nicole Cooper: Quatre cent quatre-vingt treize. Kids want to win. To win, they have to be right. And to be right, they have to learn.

Nicole Cooper: At Fauquier High School, we have about 1,400 students. I think our school gives the kids a lot of freedom, almost the feel of a mini college campus. Creating a positive learning experience for the kids, that’s what makes me tick.

Addie: She always has something fun to do. The challenges really help us to learn and get us out of the comfort zone a little bit.

Nicole Cooper: Aujourd’hui on va réviser les verbes… Addie 1: Today, we’re going to revise the verbs. So right now, in my French 3 class, they’re making sure they know all those basic verbs.

Kiersten: They all have a song connected to them. It gives you like something to remember other than just like, je suis, tu es—instead, it’s like, <sings> je suis, tu es.

Addie: Some of the songs are actual songs, like “Happy Birthday” or like the French national anthem. Some of them are just like fun beats, and it helps us remember like the conjugations and the endings of the verbs.

Kiersten: So today in class, we played the Riff-Off game, kind of like from Pitch Perfect . That’s what we got the name from. She picks a team to start, and then they pick what verb they want. They’ll sing it, and if they’re right, they’ll pick another team and they’ll give them a verb to sing.

Addie: And if you get it wrong or crack under pressure or if you don’t show enthusiasm, you get eliminated.

Nicole Cooper: Vous êtes éliminé!

Kiersten: And then it kind of just repeats itself until there’s only one team standing. I think that the competitiveness, it really helps motivate us to want to like beat each other.

Nicole Cooper: Les champions, bravo!

Kiersten: Our team was the last one standing, so we got some euros for it.

Nicole Cooper: Then I took them outside.

Kiersten: We played the numbers game. There’s red and a blue team. She’ll say a number, like if she said, “Dix sept,” 17, you get one and a seven and they would stand in order of the number.

Nicole Cooper: Soixante-deux.

Nicole Cooper: They keep bleu.

Kiersten: So if blue wins, then you scream like, “Allez le bleu.” If red wins, you scream, “Allez le rouge,” and whoever has more points wins. Our team did not win this one, but it was still really fun.

Addie: In classes a lot, you’re just kind of in your own little shell. But for this, it’s like everyone’s having fun, and it creates like a good environment.

Kiersten: We’re kids, so we don’t have the best attention span. So having something that will like keep us motivated to learn, it helps me remember things in my brain better than just sitting there and writing things down.

Nicole Cooper: To the people who say, “Oh, she can do that because she’s teaching a foreign language,” you could take any of those games and put it in a math class, a history class, science class, songs for concepts, for periods of history, for math equations. And the kids love it.

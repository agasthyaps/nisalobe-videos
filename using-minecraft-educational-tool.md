Minecraft, the popular sandbox game, is beloved by educators for its use as a learning tool. It enables students to explore, create and imagine in a completely different way than they could ever do in a traditional classroom. The beauty of the game is in the way it unleashes the creativity of both students and teachers.

But for Minecraft novices like me, it’s hard to know exactly where to begin unleashing all that creativity. If you’re just getting started with Minecraft, it might be helpful to use the game in an activity of your own design. That way, you familiarize yourself with the powerful tools for educators available in MinecraftEdu by building a virtual world for the class to explore before you jump into to using the game as a creative tool for your students.

A student at Quest to Learn playing Minecraft. This semester, I used Minecraft for the first time in my ninth grade science class at Quest to Learn . I decided to incorporate the game into my curriculum to meet a specific learning goal: to aid in students’ understanding of our DNA extraction lab.

In this lab, students practice a step-by-step technique that involves adding certain chemicals to a mixture of cells in order to break apart the cellular components and isolate the DNA molecules. Working with a game designer from Institute of Play at my school, we created a valuable cell model in Minecraft that could mimic the real properties of a cell, and the real interactions between a cell membrane and the different chemicals used to extract DNA, which students could experiment with in the game. If you’re considering using Minecraft in your classroom, here are four steps to walk you through incorporating the game into your curriculum.

Step 1: Define the Learning Goals The reason I chose to use Minecraft as a learning tool was to aid in the students’ understanding of our DNA extraction lab. When I did this lab with my students in the past, they walked away with very little understanding as to why they followed those steps and what exactly was happening at a cellular level. My vision was to create a cell model in Minecraft that students could explore and manipulate.

This pre-lab activity would allow them to use different “chemical tools” to break down the various parts of the cell and, in the end, identify a list of materials needed to complete the DNA extraction lab. Step 2: Create the Mechanics and Build the Virtual World Though I am a novice to Minecraft, I was able to work closely with a game designer, Claudio, to help create a realistic cell model. Using the MinecraftEdu educator tools, Claudio renamed the Minecraft tools with different chemical names.

He also figured out how to make some of the materials susceptible to certain chemical tools, while being impenetrable to others. Once this mechanic was ironed out, we were very quickly able to create the world of the cell. In the end, we had a single-player, immersive world in which students could explore the inside of a cell while using chemical tools to break through to the DNA.

They were using their content knowledge to find the DNA, and they were figuring out which chemicals were necessary to dissolve the components of the cell. Step 3: Focus the Exploration I created a student handout to serve as a guide for focusing their exploration. In addition to providing setup instructions to start that exploration, the handout included a checklist for exploring the cell, and questions for students to answer as they interacted with the different chemical tools in the cell.

The purpose of the student handout was to provide them with some sort of direction as they explored, and also to point out connections between the game and our class content that they may not have noticed on their own. We added extra organelles to the model, and we even created a realistic cell membrane that mimics the lipid bilayer found in real membranes. In addition to preparing the students for the upcoming lab activity, this game also served as review for our cells unit.

Step 4: Assess Progress Toward Learning Goals The questions on the handout also provided a way for me to assess students. I was able to see if they could make connections back to course content (review) while also getting a clear picture of whether they were able to meet the learning goal and identify the chemicals needed for the lab. By the end of the activity, they had a clear understanding of the changes the cell goes through during the DNA extraction lab, and when we actually completed the lab, the students felt comfortable talking about it and could successfully explain why we used each chemical.

The activity was a resounding success. Engagement was at an all-time high. Students who felt weak in science class were able to approach the subject in a way that felt comfortable for them.

Some students who were new to Minecraft struggled in the beginning, but quickly picked it up after a brief tutorial from a Minecraft regular. My students ask me often when we will use Minecraft again. I already have two projects in the works, both involving the use of Minecraft as a creative tool so that students are actually creating something of their own that’s unique.

## Transcript

Using Minecraft as an Educational Tool Joel: Minecraft is a video game that has a lot to offer. At its core, it’s very open-ended. If you want to have an adventure, you can have an adventure. If you want to build something, you can build something. If you want to talk to your friends, you can talk to your friends. If you want to kill monsters, you can kill monsters. So the game appeals to a lot of people. It makes a lot of sense to take a game that is already fun, that is proven to be enjoyable to kids, and try to find a way to bring it into the classroom.

Lauren: So look here, Minecraft EDU launcher and that should be it.

Boy: Oh.

Boy: Imagine how long this took Brandon to make.

Boy: I know. Oh! He just drops you from all the way up there.

Joel: You know, my school as well as many others have been struggling with the issue of how to teach digital citizenship, which is internet ethics, online safety, privacy, research. I mean, it’s everything, because as our kids were getting into middle school and high school we had a lot of frankly ugly incidents happen. And so, you know, the school’s administration, along with the computer department, decided we really need to start teaching this concepts earlier. You know, we’re going to treat the game world as part of the classroom. It is a classroom, it’s just in the digital space. Almost every single kid finally kind of came around and sort of got it.

Teacher: Go ahead and let’s start off by getting in, following the instructions that are up onto the board. Yeah, you are students, pick your avatar.

Anthony: Pixel Pushers as a student project here at the ETC is working with Minecraft EDU to develop a series of software features for their software. So our programmers have been working on a quiz block and a lesson review tool to include in the Minecraft EDU software while we’re also working on researching how and what you can best teach with Minecraft. You can really teach a wide array of things that aren’t immediately obvious.

Joel: The kids have to think it’s fun, otherwise what’s the point? There’s plenty of educational games out there and frankly, very, very few of them have ever been very satisfying for me. I never wanted to use them in my classroom, because it smells like school. Make sure you’re using the right material. Make sure you’re not using gravel for the parts that are in between the pillars there, because the gravel will fall. Let’s check out group two, oh nice, you’ve finished, you’re almost done with one of the hardest shapes, good job.

Anthony: In our research, we started out asking, “What can Minecraft teach?” As we actually started play testing with students, we found that that might be the wrong question and that it’s more interesting to ask how can Minecraft teach?

Dave: The virtual world of Minecraft I think is fun and powerful, you know, for these kids and I think they get it in a way that I think some of their teachers don’t sometimes.

Anthony: I think the most important thing for someone coming to Minecraft from an educational perspective is to just play the game. Just get a feel for how the game works and then perhaps even more importantly, let the students play the game.

Joel: You have to think about where twenty-first century kids are living. I mean, they come here in school, but they’re texting each other on the way home. And then they’re on Facebook and then they’re playing games together. It’s all a continuum; they don’t separate the conversations that they have typed into Minecraft with the ones that they have in the lunchroom.

Joel: There’s such excitement around this game. Getting that excitement into schools all over the world. The more voices we have coming up with idea and creating content and sharing content, the better.

## Article

Executive function is the brain’s air traffic controller, intercepting a tangle of thoughts and impulses and steering them toward safe, productive outcomes. Executive function allows children to improve their abilities to stay focused, plan ahead, regulate their emotions, and think flexibly and creatively. Cultivating these skills, the research suggests, should be a priority from elementary school through high school—and perhaps even into college—and executive function remains one of the most reliable predictors of success in academics and in life, beating out test scores, IQ, and socioeconomic status.

## Transcript

Narrator: Executive function is the brain’s air traffic controller. It intercepts a tangle of inbound thoughts and impulses and steers them toward productive outcomes. Executive function helps students stay focused, plan ahead and set goals, regulate emotions, monitor their own learning, and think flexibly and creatively. But children aren’t born with executive function skills. They develop over time. In fact, the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain which houses executive functions, is still maturing well into our teens and 20s. So, teaching executive function skills should start early, be reinforced regularly, and continue up through high school, at least. How do you do that? Don’t just teach content. Look for ways to take a step back and give students the skills and the discipline to learn on their own and remember that failure is part of the process. Academic preparation needs to be taught. Show students how to use calendars and to-do lists, for example, to manage their time and plan ahead. Encourage students to ask questions like, “Do I have a plan for succeeding at this? What was confusing or difficult about that task? How can I do better next time?” The research shows that metacognitive strategies lead to better preparation, planning and performance. And high stress levels can impair executive function. So, consider activities like mindfulness or meditation to help students deal with stress, and don’t skimp on recess. Spend the time. The research backs you up. Executive function is a more accurate predictor of success than test scores, IQ, or socioeconomic status.

## Article

While much energy has traditionally been devoted to keeping a quiet and orderly classroom, research shows that making the most of students’ drive to be social can actually have positive results. Turning students loose for a discussion can feel overwhelming, particularly with a large or lively class, so bringing some structure to group conversations can help everyone stay focused. And while productive talk may take time and practice, encouraging students to articulate their ideas can build self-confidence and improve both academic achievement and collaboration skills.

## Transcript

Traditionally, a quiet classroom was seen as an effective one. It meant the focus was on the learning task at hand. And the idea of lots of chatter can be overwhelming, especially if your class is large or easily goes off-topic. But getting your students to share their thinking and discuss content with each other makes for deeper learning. In fact, tapping into kids need to connect and be social can better engage your students and improve sense-making and retention. Facilitating student participation in academic talk, rather than just social conversation, can require some support at the beginning. When teachers let students loose for a discussion, keeping them on topic is a common concern. Or students may have trouble getting started, but a little structure goes a long way. Try providing talk moves, little cards placed on students work tables that contain phrases like, I agree because…I heard you say…I’d like to add on. These sentence starters help shy or reluctant kids choose how to contribute. They encourage all students to stay focused and engaged. Getting students to share ideas with each other can be a challenge. Partner activities work, but then students are only hearing from one other person, and often stick with a friend. To expose your students to lots of different ideas, try a double circle. Split students into two equal groups. The inner circle faces out, and the outer circle faces in, so each student has a partner. Present a question or idea to the class, and let the discussion begin. After a few minutes, ask the outer circle to step to the right, so everyone gets a new partner. With this round-robin approach, students will move out of their comfort zone and exchange perspectives with someone new. Maybe your class is very enthusiastic, and you have concerns about everyone talking at once, or a few students dominating the conversation. For more structured and equitable sharing out, consider using a talking piece. The talking piece may be a stick, a rock, or any interesting object that can be passed easily. Get creative. Start by circling up your students, presenting a topic, and setting expectations. The person with the object is the only one speaking, while everyone else is actively listening. Each person who wants a turn will get one. When the student with the talking piece is done, they pass it along. By providing a more orderly approach to classroom talk, you’ll hear from all the voices in the room, not just those who typically contribute. And everyone can develop their listening skills.

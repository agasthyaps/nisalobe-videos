# A New Theory on the Teen Mental Health Crisis

> While rising rates of teen mental health issues can’t be pinned to a single root cause, a 2023 study surfaced a compelling connection to the decline in childhood independence.

There is growing concern around the widespread mental health issues that teenagers face , and while finding causes can be elusive, a recent study reveals a new angle—rooted in childhood development—that is gaining traction. In 2023, researchers compiled and assessed data trends that showed a drop in opportunities for children to engage in play, chores, and roles that are not directly overseen and controlled by adults. Unsupervised play and purposeful work contribute to the development of important feelings of competence, autonomy, and relatedness in childhood and adolescence, which lead to healthy young adults.

Without those opportunities, children may be missing out on a critical part of their growth. The message seems clear—adults should strive to ensure that children have ample chances to grow in their confidence through independent play and exploration.

## Transcript

Narrator: Parents, teachers, and medical professionals are all concerned about the alarming decades-long rise in teenage mental health issues, including depression, persistent feelings of loneliness, and drug addiction. The root causes are elusive. Cell phones and social media are prime suspects. No surprise there, but a 2023 study offers another explanation that’s gaining traction. After sifting through surveys, historical datasets, and other cultural artifacts, researchers theorized that a primary cause is “a decline over decades in opportunities for children and teens to play, roam, and engage in other activities independent of direct oversight and control by adults.” Historical articles, books, and advice columns on child-rearing depict a bygone era when young children walked or cycled to school alone and contributed to family and community life through meaningful chores and jobs. If that all feels vaguely mythical, data collected over the last 50 years reveals a correlation. Parents admit that their children play outdoors independently much less than they did at the same age, and data confirms a big drop in the number of kids who travel to school alone or are allowed to cross busy roads by themselves. Risky and unsupervised outdoor play, meanwhile, which might protect against the development of phobias and reduce future anxiety by increasing the person’s confidence that they can deal effectively with emergencies, according to the researchers, is often frowned upon. That last point is crucial because dozens of studies suggest that happiness in childhood, and then later in adolescence, is driven by internal feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Independent play, purposeful work, and important roles in classrooms and families are vital early forms of practice. Whatever the causes, young children seem to sense that something is off. In one 2017 study, kindergartners who viewed images of fun activities routinely struck pictures that included adults from the category of play, rejecting the role of grown-ups in a domain that they clearly saw as their own.

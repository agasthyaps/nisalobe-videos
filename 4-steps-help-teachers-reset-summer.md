## Transcript

Narrator: Reflection is a key component of professional growth for educators, but making time for meaningful self-reflection can feel all but impossible amid the flurry of the school day. The end of the year provides a great opportunity to look back on standout moments with students, reflect on challenges you’ve overcome, and celebrate a year’s worth of growth. Most teachers are exhausted by May or June, but carving out a little time for taking stock now while it’s fresh in your mind will set you up for success when it’s time to head back into the classroom.

Narrator: High-quality classroom materials can have a big impact on student learning and engagement. Take 5 or 10 minutes to review your most important materials, lesson plans, visual aids, or even the four walls of your classroom. Try sitting in or envisioning your classroom, taking a look around and asking yourself questions like “What displayed student work stands out to me?” Or “What spaces in my room best support student learning?” Keeping your reflection focus narrow will simplify the process and prevent it from feeling overwhelming.

Narrator: Research has shown that writing things down in a journal or on sticky notes encodes information more deeply in your memory. Using the note-taking strategy of your choice, allow yourself to ponder deeper questions like “What do I know now compared to the beginning of the school year?” Or “What’s one thing I’d like to do differently next year?” Consider storing your notes in an email you schedule to send to yourself just before school starts so they’re easily accessible when you need them.

Narrator: Sharing reflections about your teaching and learning experiences with another educator can improve your practice and theirs too. Extend an invite to a colleague to collaboratively reflect and support each other while sharing your insights on the past school year. This exchange not only helps build stronger bonds and solidarity with your peers but provides a unique opportunity to gain perspective on your goals and challenges.

Narrator: Taking a moment to celebrate successes and acknowledge lessons learned will help you return to your classroom with a fresh lens on teaching and learning. Tuck your notes away somewhere safe, and then enjoy some much-deserved time to reset and recharge. When the new school year rolls around, you will already have a list of tight takeaways from the previous one to help you spring into action.

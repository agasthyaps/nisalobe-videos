# Building Argumentation Skills in Math

> Instead of rushing to find a solution, this math activity forces students to slow down, consider evidence, and deepen their understanding of the concepts.

At Henderson Inclusion School in Boston, middle school teacher Connell Cloyd uses a collaborative activity called the “carousel” to help his students articulate their math reasoning. This activity was developed by Boston Debate League as part of their Debate-Inspired Classrooms program .

## Transcript

Connell Cloyd: There’s four problems around the room. Each problem is solved incorrectly. We’re going to carousel around to each problem.

Cloyd: I give them the problem. They just want to get to the answer and be done with it. The guilt of American mathematics is that it’s predicated on what’s right and what’s wrong for so many years that, that’s sort of put us behind the world in mathematics, where other countries, kids build an argument for or against whatever, you know, problem that they were presented with. And so I want my kids to have that opportunity as well.

Cloyd: Now you’re going to do a different job at each different station.

Cloyd: The carousel is really one of those collaborative activities where you’re just interested in the kids’ discourse. It’s about slowing down the mathematical thinking. I put the groups together strategically. Some talkers and some thinkers and some whisperers. And it really gives them a richer conversation about math.

Cloyd: As a group, we stand here, we’re going to read the problem very carefully, and then we’re going to take a look and try to figure out “What did Mr. Cloyd do wrong on that problem?” Student: You may have multiplied the one half differently, like… Cloyd: OK, sounds good. Write that down.

Cloyd: First job, you really just have to make a claim.

Cloyd: When I say, move on, you’re going to move counterclockwise, OK? I’m going to mosey over to job number two. When I get here, whatever the group before me—whatever they claim—I want to read the claim, look at the problem.

Cloyd: And now you can either support it or refute it, depending upon what they said.

Student: I agree. I agree with the claim.

Cloyd: OK, so you agree?

Student: No, actually no… Cloyd: OK, so we thinking, we thinking now.

Cloyd: So again, you have to slow down. You have to process what somebody else has written about the problem, and see if you agree with it or if you disagree with it.

Cloyd: Now, when I write in my evidence, ladies and gentlemen, I’m not showing any numbers. I’m writing my evidence based on the concept.

Student: It’s wrong because, like, it says it’s five hours, like, every inch, but, like, if you look over here, like, like right here, it stops at 10 and 5.

Student: So, do I write that, right?

Student: Yeah.

Student: Stops at 10.

Cloyd: Finally, when you get to job number three, you rotate again, you get to job number three, now, finally, you can solve the problem.

Student: We already know it!

Cloyd: Which is what so many of them want to do initially.

Student: And 10.5 times 30 would equal… Cloyd: But still, you still have to read the claim and the evidence that came prior to you coming.

Cloyd: Come on, everybody, gather round.

Cloyd: And then the fourth job, now there’s a whole argument there for you. And it’s on you now to learn that argument, see if you agree with it, and then you have to present that argument, which is the kicker.

Student: Here is what’s wrong. They added these after… Like, they multiplied as these, and then they added, they just kept adding, yeah they kept adding.

Cloyd: If I come over and there’s a dead spot, say, in the conversation, I just start asking probing questions to sort of get them to get the ball rolling.

Cloyd: Let me ask you a question. Is it possible that more than one thing is wrong with this problem? I’m gonna let you all think about that. Think about that. I’ll be right back.

Cloyd: I’m also a firm believer in wait time, because, you know, kids are standing there, they trying to process. And so I give them that wait time, and you notice, I was just standing there too. Looking, you know. It’s about being able to look at a full argument and critique it.

Cloyd: I tell you what, I’m gonna step in the background, and I want you all to discuss whatever ideas you have about the problem. I’m going to step in the background.

Cloyd: I want them to be able to respectfully challenge the status quo. And the carousel activity really gives them that voice to do so.

Student: I agree.

Cloyd: All right. Any questions about that, ladies and gentlemen? All right. Excellent.

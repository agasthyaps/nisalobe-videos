## Article

This classroom activity, also known as Concentric Circles or Inside/Outside Circles, helps young people practice sharing their thoughts and ideas with many different partners in a low-stakes environment. It can be particularly useful for English language learners as they work on oral communications, build fluency, and sharpen active listening skills.

## Transcript

Fatima Belouahi: So one’s a circle inside and one’s a full circle on the outside, too, OK.

Fatima Belouahi: Some days our students want to talk to, you know, their best friend or the one that sits beside. With double circle, they’re forced to talk to people with different opinions.

Girl: That’s where you get your morals, your ethics.

Fatima Belouahi: I have them choose their own partner in the beginning, someone they are comfortable with. One person stands in the outer circle and the other stands in the inner circle. And then I had some questions on the board that I read aloud. And then they had to discuss them with each other. And then the inner circle steps to the right, and then they get a new partner and then a new question. And hopefully we go through all the questions with the different people. The questions provoke them into taking a stand, what they believe is right or wrong. It’s kind of forcing them to explore their own classroom and to talk with others.

Girl: What about— Boy: Mmm.

Girl: Oh, yeah, I know. Plus, I mean, look at mine. See.
